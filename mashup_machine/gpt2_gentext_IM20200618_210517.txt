my dream is to travel the face of the sun
and into the hearts of the men
who were slain by the archers
at the gates and the walls of montségur
in the fields and the cities of montségur
in the fields and the cities of montségur
in the fields and the cities of montségur
in the fields and the cities of montségur
in the fields and the cities of montségur
in the fields and the cities of montségur
in the fields and the cities of montségur
in the fields and the cities of montségur
in the fields and the cities of montségur we are not his chosen people
we have fled his land
we will be slaves to his will
and when he says you must pray
tell him you are with your families
bring your sacred book
like a bridge too high
over the ocean in a boat
never seen such a face
before my vision, i felt no fear
oh, my heart is heavy with worry
and now, i feel no pain at all
as the waves and echoes of the ships break
and my heart is crying
====================
some birds out of season, some hedonists waiting
you've just got to watch them
to mesmerize them, bleed them away
crushed by their icy dead rest
lost in a time of truth
what do you think you want when you see the same thing again?
just what you pay for my ignorance, my sin
my reputation as one of the bravest soldiers
until my very own death, i pay for what i tell you
i tell you what you want, i tell you what you want
if you're taking me for an erfurt party
what do you think you'd expect you would see?
this is no joke
this is real life for fools
what do you think you'd expect you would see?
this is no joke
this is real life for fools
there's a time when you're standing in the sun
rising early in the morning
to clean the houses, the clothes
while the kids play
figure out what's funny and what's not
what do you think you'd expect someone to see?
this is no joke
this is real life for fools
there's a time when you're standing in the sun
rising early in the morning

====================
our biggest fear is getting shot down

just because you know what's on our minds doesn't mean we don't act on it
we're making decisions that will forever alter the course of our lives
and without a doubt, you've already seen it
but what really makes you feel?
there's something about the way we behave that makes us think we're going to die
this sense of dread makes us run wild
hunting is a life that you keep
the best weapons are the ones you've got
running from the law

there's something about the way we behave that makes us feel

it must be the end of winter
the wildest dreams in town
shoten venders in the tooth
do you know what it's like to be a war horse
soldier blue in the barren wastes
hunting is a life that you keep
the best weapons are the ones you've got
running from the law
hunting is a life that you keep
there's something about the way we behave that makes us feel

it must be the end of winter
the wildest dreams in town

we've got a strange love, Believe me!
he lives in the city called vellum
he never speaks the proper script
he always brings his wife and young daughter
he never pays their rent, they've gone to hell for us
he's coming back once again
he's a stranger to himself
a strange love is a loose cannon
we've got a strange love, Believe me
he lives in the city called vellum
he never speaks the proper script
he is a dirty lucre man
you'll never know he's inside your head
until you try to take it
you'll be shouting and jumping up and down
attacking him hard, day and night
in the fields and at night the drum fills
his eyes seem so plain and you know he's inside you in your darkest hour
you've got to cry when you don't have a father
and to wonder if your children

the desperate prayer is answered

they're searching for the body of a lost child
a wanted man, he's found it
seems there's something buried deep inside
do you hesitate to take a step towards the edge?
but you take your stand just as you see the shadows of the past
gone are the days when men lived by the sword
gone are the days when they died by the sword
but the past

swift as a knife edged sword
with thunderbolt in my mind
could this be it?
it's been three long years since i died
and with that, i've got to say that
i am really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, living my dream, living my dream everyday
no driving, living my dream behind closed doors
signal 100 miles an hour stranger than a dream
who knows, maybe he's an asshole
it's not till many hours pass that i start to see the signs
of my death, when you've turned 180 degrees and started turning your back on each other
that you think i'm skinny, it's because i'm moving through the dirt
hard as a lunge, ready to strike
movement of my foot soldiers
movement of my brain as i follow the movement
beat on the door, tap on the wooden floor
listen closely to the murmur of alarm
coming to you from far away
you're looking at me now
waiting for the train to finish, before it slams against the

don't you hear the blood? oh, crying, no more tears
better to go back to my room
better to get dressed and leave
won't you go back?
walk away, don't you hear me?
don't you hear the blood? crying, no more tears
better to go back to my room
better to get dressed and leave
waiting for the start of the fight
bouncing back and forth between love and hate
running back in the village remember when we used to dream
all the colours, all the smells and all the attitudes
when we were running away
wanting to be friends with everyone
i've been looking all your way
looking so lonely now
it's only a dream, a means to an end
thinking of a way to send jaywalking

it's only a photograph, a spanner in your eye
it's not the glamour or the glamour a dream, it's reality

good day, country
don't know where it all started
maybe it's the surmounting terror
of the unknown man
nothing is real until you feel
it's when you know you've got someone to save you
it's there you hide and wait for the morning rush
to die, and be saved by a race
a race that is made of the living dead
a race that has no memories
a race that is shape-shifters in the dead of night
you are a human wave arises
and the dead go flying
reincarnates in the dunes, into the sunset
shadows in the sand, i'll be the first to admit
we're not stupid, we're not into arguing

humans on the cross

humans on the cross

burning brighter than a century of sun

he wasn't prepared for the shock
when hollow lead bit into his head
a new martyr for the book of rock
a new martyr for the book of rock
the book of rock
a new martyr for the book of settle down!
she's got legs... like an airship
she's got an arse.... like coal tip
she's got tits... just like hot air balloons... and i mean the hindenburg!
she's the biggest girl, i'm gonna get there soon
yeah, you know what i mean
she's got love when you want it, but she never lets go when you get it
you disappear inside, you're never seen again... lost
====================
you get what you pay for, i'm not gonna argue
about the wars in india
soldier-killer, fugitive, criminal
the world's number one importer
in 1981 the war was over
now the victims are left behind
desertions of life
traitors to mankind
plenty can be found
at the edge of the law
in the shadow of the city
in the darkness there's no smile
the smile of a lucky winner
there's a lost cause and it's just
worthwhile talking about
what we've done
never goin' down on us
we got to get this far
i'm not a politician
i'm a warlord
we're fighting for the
blood of kings
wounded warriors
in the black
take a breath and stand
we're not politicians
we're a bloody crime syndicate
we fire at the gates, we're tough on the criminals
we pay the bartenders what they charge
we kill the birds of prey that we find
and we poison the wine we drink
in the dark of the night, the venomous snakes
that prey on our touch
the whispered message is that we die
in a corner
====================
stay strong
the empire of the clouds
just died down here on the ground
i've just got to wonder why
here we are, a few hundred souls
with nothing to lose, and nothing left for big war
just because you're kind
 doesn't mean you're wrong
and if you're just living a delusion
don't new dawn speculation
nothing to lose, and nothing to lose, war is never ending
justify our cause, lift us up
out with the rest of the world
when war is finally won
and the world ablaze
what will it be called?
aid or comfort?
just a guess...
you know, it's all just a bloody misunderstanding
of what the time really is
can't put your finger on it, but
it seems to rile up the men
all the while the mention of
"the battle of the lakes"
can't bring itself to say what
whatever the cause, it's got to do with
mercy or damnation!
knowing we din't have a choice
we're in a terrible place, there's no way
don'tths and fools all over the place
they're taking medicine for treatable
====================
i've been looking all night and hours haven't turning out howling into the silent moon
look out, lamia, we'll see what the bloody hell
she's seen what you've done
she can tell you nothing you don't know
will you be afraid to take charge if you turn your back on me?
you've turned your back on me, you've done the work
you turn your back against me, you've done nothing at all
you turn your back against me, you've done something that you'd done before
don't be so damn petty as to call me a freak
just a man who's looked into the night
oh, lamia, you've opened my eyes, you won't have any further proofs
you've shown me your secret gallery
they are my only refuge, only horror beyond
oh, lamia, you've opened my eyes, you won't shrink from me
only fear will save me
only fear will save me
only fear will save me
only fear will save me
only fear will save me
only fear will save me
only fear will save me
only fear will save me
only fear will save me
only fear will save me

====================
you can tell me if i'm free
you can tell me if i'm strong
you can tell me if i'm strong
you can tell me if i'm strong
you see i'm gonna be alright
you see i'm gonna be safe
when you're searching for the truth
you always feeling scared when you see what's left
your prayers answered when you reach the destination
when you're searching for the truth
no one knows what the secret is anymore
you're running free like a free man
you're running free on a gator
you got the money, you got the gun
you're in the lead up, the fight's still start
you're on your knees, the gun's gonna get you in the mud
but the poor guy, he's got the money to spend
he's walking right on through
he's gonna get you in the mud, yeah
he's gonna get you in the mud if you're gonna bloody help me
if you're gonna bloody help me, i'm gonna get in the way
i'm gonna get in the way, i'm gonna get in the mud
so get in the way, i'm gonna get in the mud

you want to pay me for the fun of it?
well, come and play with me
gonna need a key to unlock the door
got me this, now get me out of here
gonna fix this, this, this
gonna get me out of this
vacation in smoke and mirrors
lost my love, lost my life
all because of you
it was only for a matter of facture
and when that exchange was
through your ear
you'd better know me
before you go looking for help
getting me out of this for a living
swinging like a wench
sticking with the devil even after
chasing a dead cat out on the town
oh, but what if it's
ever your turn?
you've got a reputation as a guy
who'll take no prisoners
but when you track him
down he knows you've got a long ways to go
when you're first getting
off the hooks you pay the price of fame
the name you nick is a long, winding road
and you've got a reputation as a
fighter with a sense of humour
you use a bollocking pole
and Ickney whip round your
====================
you know they wanna call it good ole days after the war, grey eyes burn with the vengeance
we gotin' up the bunks, we'ret powers, we'ret swords, we'retamas, we'retanks, we'retanks...
i'm jam-packed, thawnin' around...
nothing is ever the way it should be
but when you'retaring the stalactites
nothing is fair just a few more bloody figures
in a bloody stupid game of swords
telling a sad story about how he's fallen victim to the lure of the sea
tell me why...
steve: what is it that goes through your mind?
nicko: it's not very well thought-out or drawn out
nicko: it goes through me fast
e=mc squared, that's what i'm directed at

====================
real love or fantasy or whatever, i just want to fall in love with you
that is, until you hit on your last wish
i know this may seem like a long time, but still i'm on the run
oh...

it's only been a matter of weeks, a few small victories
but there's more to come
the hunter is always looking for, and taking pride
that you have so much potential inside
you just can't take anything a secret
the enemy lines a 2x2
the distance, the distance, the distance
the greater the size the greater the risk
the hunger, the risk, the reward
killer's breed, the forgotten majority
we'll meet the majority of the dead
when every man stands on his own two seats
and the majority get along just fine
when every man stands on his own two seats
and the majority get along just fine
but a bullet's still going in the fence
home, far away
you gotta keep an open mind when it's time
but when you're waiting in line
for the next step, it seems
it's getting closer and closer
the fear of the dark seems stronger every day
i sit in silence
====================
a year of doing and nothing at all
she sat there looking at the sky and taunting me
"you fools she is, you'll never know she ever even made it through cancer"
brought home by the gator
"luck is always a factor"
a year goes by and she's sick and tired of the pain
and me, she's always got the bug
you know she's got the heart
and you know she just can't take no more
the muggers, the sweatshirts, the blacksmiths, the barbershop workers - she's the one!
she's the one, she's the whore
she's the one, she's the trickster
she's the one, she's the juanita rosenthal
she brought home the baby
who will replace her if she goes?
there's so much left over from the macedonian vikings battle
vicinity restated
sacred trophies, they're all gone
gone are the days when man looked down
suffering evil when he laid off his sheep
i heard the rumbling of guns
and i knew i'd be hunted down like the Hickoryrats
when the time
====================
and i'm always out, always out
looking for a message from me
don't you hear the sirens?
a sheriff's deputy pulls up at about 3 a.m.
he pulls the trigger and i feel the moment's left in my life
and i'm never goin' back juanita
get out of my way, hey?
she's stepin' out in the yard

you have spoken with the demon Lord thyself
you have sensed that there is an impending disaster
you have sensed that the disaster is near
you have spoken with the spirit of the ancient east
you have sensed that the path is clear
you have spoken with the mind of a warrior
you have fought many a battle
and they have said the same thing
you have heard the angels cry
you have felt the blood go down their throats
and now it's over for them all
you have the power to heal
you have the power to speak their language
you have used the power of the dark nights
overcome your demons and your lies

so kneel and look around, oh why don't you try to reason why
free your feet and get you moving oh why don't you try to reason why
so sit down, somebody's singing and i can't hear my voice
so when you're singing and you feel like going to the ground
but you don't seem to have any friends on the ground
is this a bad sign?
maybe it's just that somebody's been crying?
look out, somebody's singing and they're crying
but when you've got so much love inside it's hard to move
don't you know if it's a sign of disease or just plain tired of living

who will take the victory
hell and earth are in the balance
and if you die then so be it
you know the truth from your lies
begging for salvation while waiting for the dawn
living on the edge, no fly on the walls
no we can find peace only god would know
so we can make our beds and be free
we've got to get away from this corner of town

turning the tide of the battle
oh, my heart is heavy as i turn my back and leave

we're choosing death over life
i have a lust for their corpses
my inner voice rings with fear
and as i get closer to succumbing to my lust
i get the feeling that my life's really over and away

there's something that reminds you of drowning
your first feelings will be revealed

you decide to swim in

only the bloody knowledge remains to lead a life of drug use
no longer can we let anyone into our lives
we've got to get them away
suspected of a hit, a lorry journeyman's draw
he shows no emotion as his face turns to ashes
only the bloody residue of the crimes he has done
his face floats in the wind
with all the guilt and pain
seemingly human remains of a person lying next to him
eating grasses, watering the graves
he killed her and gave her a cow
ol' yarmouth man,' you're telling me he's rich
my good man is satin' and your boots are soft
that's why you're here
drum roll tight boys and don't let them get in your way
the smell of burn bales of the dead is burning bright
here's some room service for thought
oh, boy!
don't forget to turn off the light
and tell me what do you want
to know about the bloody business
caught up in a web of lies
that the bloody official in me
has decided to stand by his man
because if you tell me he knows

is it them who are praying?
you can say they're sick, but don't tell them that
you tell them what you want to hear
we'll take it as an attack
we'll surround you with barbed wire
and as you lay there lying on your bed
with your eyes blood has begun to flow
into your brain creating a desperate scream
it's a new day, a new phase for you
you have no choice, but to wait
and suffer the consequences when the symbol of the hour
turns out midnight is now
that you know the answer to your phone
it's Simon de Luca's birthday!
you know he's brilliant
he's the man behind the curtain
he really is the man

i want to play with no players
i hear voices in my head
i can't see far,

i'm running a small business

you've gotta admit...
it's surreal...
seems like the biggest mistake you make
your whole life seems so... meaningless
when you're floating on empty skins
and your soul's broken
you've gotta admit you don't know what's real
and the only thing that can cure you
is to try to remember the reasons
why you're floating on hopelessness
and burning with life
you know, and i know that's the key
to get you over the edge
is to try to remember the past
the things that you see
the future may be vivid
and the past a strange dream
is it the future that you want to see?
but if you don't see it'll haunt you for a long time
inside your head, you decide
can't you see it'll be something real?
and now it's heavy and the fog has lifted
your heart's beating loud
see my angel, your crying is too much for you
can't you see it'll be something real?
rarely enough to send you flying
but now it's heavy and the fog has lifted
your heart's beating loud
mother of mercy
angel of death!
are you sick

good afternoon,
my name is Daniel.
my name is on the bloke's bucket list.
i'm a technical foul on one of my buses
one day i was out on the streets
in a bloody sweat you looked like you were burning
burning on the outside, on the inside
smell like the sulphur of lead
burning in the night, on the inside
somewhere you had your beer, didn't you?
did you know that there was a bus with me?
a bloody truss rod on the end table
and a bloody golf ball out of the bloody wind
went down like a virus, like a cancer
you could smell it in the air
and i was out of town by the way
so why don't you tell me why
trying to work out why

====================
an adaptation of my long-running, surrealist novel, Dream in a Daydream
who's who at the barber's, shouting "come on, let's get dressed"
i've never felt so real before but it's getting closer as the night goes on
look out, stranger things are happening all the time
more and more of the shadows are blocking our vision
time to look into a new world for yourself
charlotte can't be blamed for this loneliness
she always is, never miss it
dream in a dream girl, come again
eleven, stranger things are happening all the time
charlotte can't be blamed for this loneliness
even when she's with you, she never lets you be
charlotte can't be blamed for this loneliness
even when she's with you, she never lets you be
charlotte can't be blamed for this loneliness
even when she's with you, she never lets you be
always in the dark when you're out and about
always in the dark when you're at the gates
always in the dark when you're walking the straightest path
always in the dark when you're feeling down and broke
i've got a
====================
say it ain't so
reaper, you killed my son
riding the blood of the cross
and after the friday rains we rollin' around ungodly scenes
but n' i'm workin' down the line
i just don't want anybody hear my song
i just don't want anybody to get hurt
anyway, got to get down on my knees
and say the union starts
oh, a minute, the clock goes down
oh, another monday morning call
oh, another minute, the clock goes down
2:20 a.m.: the rolling hills await
the early rising sun shines in the sky
a misty night's the night before
a cold voice calls out my name
i am running from the army of the darkness
i am running from the dark
away from the bruce drog jokes
they look like they've been hit by a truck
someone's crying in the stands
the bass is shoving beer too far
the stage is sapping strength
and the crowd goes crazy as the song begins
the frenchman says something unintelligible
someone's crying in the stands
the stage is draining the crowd

and the crowd
====================
remove all the threads and begin the work
new beginnings, the beginnings of a life of wealth and comfort
the lifeboat they called the jester so we knew his name
the telescope and the dials looked out into the stars
didn't matter, got nothing to do
i'm running rings around you
don't you hear me call?
stop what you're doing?
what did you do?
two weeks after the disaster, i'm still here
in some strange island off the coast of rage
in an unknown part of the ocean, i'm still alive
i didn't die, i'm just living my life to the bone
i'm a man of peace, he's a soldier of god
if there's one thing i know
it's that you must name it
well, that was a mistake
you didn't make a mistake, you made one
make that mistake, now it's too late
you're a coward, now you're a coward
people don't care if disasters strike every once and awhile
they'll go to heaven or will they die on the spot
cold blood, blood on the street, my home is ajar
cold blood, blood on the street,
====================
the crazy things that they do, they're so unintelligible
i mean they'll never work in the first ever air raid
warning: the final whistle blows
enter the enemy lines
enter the battle, no warning and no surrender
defeat awaits
the vanquished, take what lives
they're living legend in our dreams
no turning back
we're in our late fifties, a half century old
and the war begins
eat your heart away
we're fighting in a bloody bloody political battle
you have the right to expect
that our ideals will be preserved
and we believe in that right
that no-one can take secret
that the system is corrupt
and that the people are sick of living in fear
everyone has the right to organize
you are free to organize
you may as well let your children go
you may as well let your children go
if you're going to organize it's your own good good good
we're in our late fifties a half century ago this country was great
and they made great heroes
of every class and race
from the soldiers of July
to the kind of boys and girls
that we're fighting for
we're in our
====================
the number of the beast
once given to me by my father for me
now he lurks in the trees
in the shadows watching me
watching as he perps the branches
of his tree trunks he slams his fist down
watching as he eats the flesh from the tree
orange with blood and with his tongue
my totem pole as he strikes fear into the hearts of men
through his eyes i see the evil in every man
who dreams of a better life don't know the cost to which war we join
we bleed for our lives but don't deserve it
take our swords and we'll gallop on
into the warlord's court
we'll fight with courage and a will to win
we'll win because of our blood and our blood will flow
bring freedom to the people of oceania
and we'll fight for their sake
take our swords and we'll gallop on
into the warlord's court
we'll fight for their sake
take our swords and we'll gallop on
sliding we go
and shoot the living dead
sliding we go
at the gates where we kneel
as the soldiers charge us
come the cutest of citizens
take
====================
and i can't help but feel that things are getting closer every day
i think, 'cause you know i'm the assassin
don't you know i just don't feel like a different, a matter of pride
and i always seem to be waiting in line, in front of everybody
i just hope that i get caught, cause i know it
there's like a hunger, like a thirst
that knocks on your door
you've made your mistakes, you've fixed them
you're coming to get me, i'm coming to get you
cause i'm a human wave comes over the ocean waves
in the night, the mesmerizing sound
of waves crashing and crashing
against the walls, dreaming and waking
scream for mercy, he won't let you go
he's the gyre man, he's pulling the strings
he's the wave man, he's pushing the buttons
you'll never see this ship again
in the mud and rain and earthquakes
and the politicians, they're making us pay
he's the ploughman, he's driving the twists and turns
and the balance's been struck
you can't help but feel that he's down the
down with the mag
====================
you really need to know
to save your soul if you're gonna get this much love
don't waste your time, your life
if you're gonna pay for this, i'm willing to pay
for this, i'll do it, no pain
no pain in the matter
no returns on my part
invest my heart and my life in this endeavor
pretty sure this isn't your first time
say a prayer when you work at it
take a picture of your heart and i'll show you all
i'm a minute, but am i spending it with such sadness?
do you feel that you've put so much faith in yourself?
have you used your time to really get into it?
have you decided that you're really not all that into things now?
maybe you're not that into it at all
do you feel that you really are that into things now?
that you've put so much faith in yourself?
have you ever felt that you're really in a l soymand?
a little something that you've done that you feel that you've put me through?
sometimes it makes me feel small and insignificant
other times it's the whole family
and the fact
====================

i'm looking forward to the day when everyone has a say
remember that day when you couldn't see the sky at night
i'm looking forward to the day when everyone has a say
well that's what i told my friends when they first got involved
we were out in the cold, there was nowhere left to run
it was pay to win, you got a shot to go
if you didn't, you were dead
you lost you dignity, you lost your mind
you lost me, the man who was never afraid to shoot
now i know why they thought i was a danger
they didn't know much about me, but they really wanted to connect
they got me hooked, i knew it, i was on the run
they got me hooked,
====================
your pay is the price of fame
i've got you hooked at the foot of my stool
hook in a day, or a shadow on the other side
you're on your own, you don't need an alter hand
you just iron it in, you just rock and roll
you rock and roll, you rock and roll
hook in a day, or a shadow on the other side
you're on your own, you don't need an alter hand
you just iron it in, you just rock and roll
you rock and roll, you rock and roll
hook in a day, or a shadow on the other side
you're on your own, you don't need an alter hand

to have the bad sense to know
to have the bad sense to know
to have the good sense to know
so when you think that you've been warned

====================
the story of a city
and the conflict
that divided the men of the blizzard
can we begin with the beginning?
dreams of the past, nightmares to fight in
there's a silent death waiting
at the gates and the walls of montségur
dreams of the past, nightmares to fight in
there's a silent death waiting
at the gates and the walls of montségur

when the river runs deep
and the line breaks
and the blood it flows
through the darkness, my blood will bleed
out for miles and miles
out for miles and miles, you liar
you who would believe
when the light of the world has gone
we can no longer trust
our lives, our companies, are in danger
living on a razor's edge, can you believe it
when you see the same old mistakes
over and over again
you begin to see how far we've come
you began to feel the fear that's inside
that's driving you insane
please tell me now what life is
please tell me now what love is
well, tell me now what war is
again, tell me what life is
please tell me now what life is

====================
getting something from the black
which i can't wait to see
i'd like to give him a call
but he's gotten so hooked
he won't tell me what he's got
mysteries of love and death
we kiss his earth, where we live
where we live and our love
we send our love on our way
we don't know where they're going
cause we're here on this earth
as part of a mission
to find and cure cancer
our mission: to humanity's starving eyes

not yourselves
bring your own light
mist will be looked on
face will be cursed
you're outnumbered by the madmen
you've got to get to break this divide
the road to Damascus is a long way from here
become a martyr for the holy city of love
riding the red horse
don't you stray from the black?
be prepared to die at the hands of those whoLive in the city of love
to the east is a crucible that swings in the wind
to the west lies the capital of the world
to the east is a crucible that swings in the wind
to the west lies love was once a holy city
now it is gone, vandalized and vandalized remains
throw the city into the wind
to the east is a crucible that swings in the wind
to the west lies the capital of the world
to the east is a crucible that swings in the wind
to the west is a crucible that swings in the wind
never thought that such a small city could hold such a great nation
knowing that my heart is heavy
i feel that my brain is reeling
could this be the sign of the end of us all?
not
====================
by now you know all my secrets
cover as i lay in bed
dream on, dream on, dream on
howling in the dark, the storm is going
the distant sound of engines makes us all turn and look
farther away, down the dark track
coming soon enough
look out, lads!
i'm running away
maybe i'll never find
out why
i'm running from the davey boys
i'm running from things their way
they never seemed to know
i've got a fever, i'm running out
oh, i'm running from them
i'm running from them
into the night
running free in the dark
dreams of the past as the old man tries to make his stand
his dark vision slowly fades away
oh, i'm running from them
i'm running from them
into the night
running free in the dark
dreams of the past as the old man tries to make his stand
his dark vision slowly fades away
oh, wandering aimlessly in the everglades
looking about looking for something
finds only emptiness - no regrets - just empty shells for a silent burial
and the bodies are laid to rest in
====================
you want to buy a ticket to vicar dame's home
she isn't here to sell you cheap wine
you've got a terrible heart, don't give me your bad luck
i've got a terrible leg
she's gonna carry you on your back
oh, oh, i can't see no more!
oh, oh, the wind's blowing in the night
you're so tired, you're looking cold in the dark
don't even try, you won't grow old
you've got so much blood, i couldn't make it to the next day
don't even try, you won't grow old
you've got so much blood, i couldn't make it to the next day

i can't wash the blood from my hands
and when you're waiting for me to get you something to drink
you're taking poison from a stranger's bed
and it's just another way for me to feel
not very social, not very religious
not very good with the children
isolation, a real end in itself
isolation, a real end in itself
and you know what they're saying about christmas brunch?
c'mon christmas! cause i know what
====================
i've just got to find the answer
or be dead, black and stranded
like the cats on a piece of metal
i have no idea what is out of the universe
what life could be, what purpose to it
would it be if there was a god?
and if god was dead, well
why did he let me go?
and who is god?
what is the purpose of existence
shall we begin?
shall we move on to the next step?
shall we move on to the next step?
is there a place where we can rest
that this world's past, present and future
could be saved?
for the living still scarred for life's fullest
is there a place where we can rest
that this world's past, present and future
could be saved?

take my hand, i'll lead you to the other side
of the bridge
of the aisle
oh, i've got you in my heart
don't you hear me call?
blade of the sun don't hurt a laugh
the people that you know
beat back the growing alarm
your time is up, you can't go wrong
time is up, you can't go wrong
and so we walk through the city
a tunnel we didn't exist by your name
a world of illusion that we live in
blade of the sun don't hurt a laugh
the people that you know
beat back the growing alarm
your time is up, you can't go wrong
time is up, you can't go wrong
brought up on the edge
always on the edge
never sure what's even true or fake
some strange love is driving you crazy
your time

the truth has not moved from the grave
measurements of war, shields of the western powers
on the walls of mortars stand the eyes of the future
intelligencia, the state of news
see the grinding horror as the bodies roll onto the ground
at the bottom of the stairs, a dark, bloodied youth
stood on the other side
as he fell upon the city floor
he had no weapon, he couldn't cut it
he had no life and he fell to his knees
as he lay there, he couldn't move
he had no life to give, he fell to his death

now he tries to move his head but it's all in the shade

when i paint this canvas black and gold
i'll never show my face again
so i go to the mirror and look in it
it's something that i've got to do
and it makes me sick, i gotta get away
but i'm not gonna let go
i'm on the brink, you'll take my soul

====================
i don't need a reason to believe
no sound to justify all my evil doings
nothing to prove or disprove
nothing weighed so heavy on my head
and now, all my doubts and fear
flicker as if there's some kind of lightness to these tears
as the fragment passes by
my spirit begins to slip away
my doubts and anxiety
not knowing what to do, waiting some other day
i keep on searching, but no-one seems to find
try as might to make a thing seem to be happy
nothing seems to come to an end
there's an evil in everything and s/he's just got to survive
keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait
go with the flow or you'll die young
starblind with the goddess of the sun
all-consuming fire
she rules over the universe
and will play the driving force
your life or be done with it?
choose a path that leads you to ruin
you'll take what is left and you'll go on to good
to live and to live, to live and to live
and be reborn again someday
you'll be so saved by the beauty of life
by your

it's ten o'clock and i am alone
i don't have a word with my husband
it's getting to me so cold
i can't hear what they're saying
and now it's getting to me
it's getting to me
livin' lovin' i'm on the outside
but on the inside
it's turning to bloody sweat
oh, how the bloody world workin' today?
not with the letter s—- off
i'm turning into a bloody satan bastard
i'm turning into a bloody satan bastard
i'm turning into a bloody satan bastard
and soon i'll be live a lie
and in the end i will be
livin' lovin' i'm on the outside
but on the inside
it's turning to bloody bloody sweat
oh, how the bloody world workin' today?
not with the letter s—- off
i'm turning into a bloody satan bastard
i'm turning into

====================
why don't you tell me why?
i'd like to know the truth, at least
at least i know what's real
and, god, i know!
help me
help me to my feet
relax, i'm on my own
i have no contact with the dead
no more lies!
no more lies!
no more lies!
no more lies!
no more lies!
no more lies!
no more lies!
they're all dead, totally dead!
oh, what a time we had!
living here, now it's gone
i've lost me place, no more friends!
...and with all my heart i've left here in this world!
i had a great time laying on the lawn, thinking about all the years i've gone
never once did i feel that i'd got it right, that i was on my own;
but now that i know that the incentive has gone
'cause i've got to get my neck on the hook for the cost of doing business
don't you know what they're saying about me?
charlotte, you're so refined
when you take all the love that they're putting up
====================
i remember feeling scared at the word 'nerd'
feelin' so lonely
i don't know how
i can communicate with my mind
mind you, i only communicate with my spirit
if you tell me that i can
let me tell you 'bout your life
you'd better get down on your knees
and think about you
refer to your past
recreate your youth
and the memories will burn
in your dreams
of a lifetime ago
remember you can't erase them
the past is living in your mind
fate has been removed
you can't erase guilt
you can't erase the past
you can't prevent the memories from re-collected
you can't erase the past, present, and future
you call it your own
but that's another day, another pain
feeling much too tired to go back
desperate enough to Escape 2x
passing the point of no return
robbing telephone ringside
saving my soul by taking my money
paper cats all over the ground
we pass the point of no return
treachery in the shadows
we walk alone towards the promised land
2x
passing the point of no
====================
or

or
or
and we take refuge in the shadow of our past
all the sins arefalling me
all the demons that prey on my soul
they are gone now
freedom, freedom, freedom

freedom, freedom

if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
just remember to bring a stick of coal
to the table and we'll talk about recipe
stick of coal? let's have it all
cause youre driving a gray vehicle
and the engine doesn't start for a second
and then the gas fills up and the sirens go
burn in your back and you feel like gimlet
cause you're holding your breath for dear life
and you can feel the tip of the gun
draw pointing in the direction of your death
don't know which until i saw it in the mirror
and it really bothered me that much
that they thought i was dead
and i didn't know if i was real or fantasy
all the while i was constantly pinging the netherworld
blood everywhere, including your kitchen
what had you eaten on the road trip
did you just stop and think
did you know what was wrong and what was right

====================
we have the demons in our hands
the devil has his eye on you
and if you're going to die
you better make a bid
to the devil's court
we have the means to dispose of ourselves
and if you're gonna die
go for a taste of the bloody wine
salvage a last touch
but before you go, i want you to know
the vicar's waiting for me
the back of the white truck
he pulls up just outside the flashing red light
and he says...
"if you're gonna die, you better get away
and if you're gonna die, don't go in there cause i'm loading you with loads o' weapons"
and that's all the killers say
and that's all the victims say
and that's all the gang do is wait for the dawn
for the turning of the tide
and the turning of the tide
wider divide
the knife of savagery has begun
the mariner's waiting for news of the day
tables flipped around just for you
the news is in your mind, ready to go
you've been warned but what is left to do
you've been warned but what is left
====================
a match made in heaven
an act of evil that will haunt me till my very demise
must see you again in paschendale, n.J.
must see you again in paschendale, n.J

she wants to buy the car, prix fixe, a Range Rover

did you know that the rangeo's dead center
and the fokker's bore hollow point?

freedom of expression
so we can all have a say
what we want to be let alone
so we can all have a say
freedom of expression
allowed us to be
allowed us to be
allowed us to be
left feeling confused and frustrated
say your story to the elders
they will all be amazed
and you too can make a difference
your time will come
your time will come
you too can make a difference
you can tell a lie at a time
you can be strong and free and some will say
smile and wave your hand
and take a drink at the table
when every man is a god
and the devil is in the details
you've got to wonder why
one look and you've got to wonder
and you're feeling down
don't be so taken up with your problems
there's so much meat and no easy way
it's hard to get through at night
i'm in love and i'm out with my mates
we're in love and we're out with our mates
there's something burning inside your mind
it's a strange feeling that stays with you
you've got to find your way
you've got to find your way

====================
i need someone to save me
the bugle sounds, the murraym see it in your eyes
passionate young man, passion is freedom

====================
and all our ancestors died for our sins
i know where you stand, you don't need look for reason to believe
or do what you will to watch the world burn
and you'll be watching up to see who's next
whatever planet die
whatever life form dies
and all our ancestors died for our sins
and all our ancestors died for their lives
to save them, with their infernal blood
666 the great, the great, the earthquake prepared
for the coming of the zodiac
666 the sign of the cross
for all your sins, such as lying
to tell the tale, such as being
free of all guilt, such as lying
free of all guilt, such as lying
by your deeds you stand, you don't need look for reason to believe
or do what you will to watch the world burn
and you'll be watching up to see who's next
whatever planet die
whatever life form dies
and all our ancestors died for their sins
and all our ancestors died for their lives

to save them, with their infernal blood
666 the great, the great, the earthquake prepared
for the coming of the zodiac
666 the sign of the cross

hahahahaha

the x factorx xi shipping
i've got so much love, it's burning right now
must have come to symbolize everything that we do
what will she become of us if we don't start saving now?
do you think she's meant to become a saint?
just think what she'd bring to the table
do you think she's even meant to be happy?
just think what she'd bring to the table
let's just say she's a mess
not just a sad wife
her misery is real and she must get better
maybe then she'll be forgiven
must keep her eyes open, baby
look on and enjoy your happy happy years

sunset, autumn and the long winter evenings

====================
shoulder a shock when the red truck pulls up beside them
the red truck in my dreams startles and gets brighter
when i stand beside you, i can feel his loving arms around my neck
we've been looking so long for this man to die
we were so young, so tired, so taken with his body
but there's something inside that wants to find something
the hours of thy journey are done
and our farewell song begins
bye bye, bye, goodbye
tag team 'rivev' for save the day
tag team 'rivev' for save the day
brought this passion and this passion only the best can create
the cynic in me wonders why we're here
the truth lies deep inside of me
and just beneath the surface, i've got a cold sweat
i've been wanting to commit suicide for ages
for this, i've got to keep trying
i have no feelings, i just hold no hatred
i have no feelings, i just hold no hatred
if you had the chance to live your life
where you live and what you do
what you do, you will be determined
i will not surrender
your land, your time
there is no other
====================
use your judgement and get ready to die
over breath of smoke and mirrors
over mirrors show what's real and what's fake
over whelk's a dry lump that's made of mirrors
over whelking's a big hairy beast that you've got to look
over whelking's got legs that get in the way
over whelking's got a really bad thirst, don't you know
and as you walk to the light that is your light
my reflection is shining not in the dark, but with the sun
reflecting the sun's light through your skin
have you looked into the heart of darkness
and noticed that it's burning bright
still burning bright in your eyes
have you thought about you life and love
and wondered if you really wanted it this much more
have you looked into the heart of darkness
and noticed that it's burning bright
still burning bright in your eyes
have you thought about you life and love
and wonder if you really want it this much more
have you looked into the heart of darkness
and noticed that it's burning bright
still burning bright in your eyes
have you thought about you life and love
and wonder if you really want it
====================
hell ain't a bad place
hell ain't a bad place
hell ain't a bad place
hell ain't a bad place
hell ain't a bad place
hell ain't a bad place, come on
hell ain't a bad place, come on
hell ain't a bad place
hell ain't a bad place come on in the night, the lights are burning
look in the mirror, and tell me which emotion i have
don't you feel bad or angry when your life is gone
and i don't know what to do, do as you please
your life is over, your soul's wasted
you're in a terrible bind, you must live on
you can't give in now you're searching
you must fight or flight, kill for a chance
to a life of comfort and security
to a world of pain and despair
i have a hold of my heart and a shot
at will, i fire back
at those who would die, i shoot back
at those who would live to fly again
at the edge of winter's glow
there are those who live by and wait
for the time is near, a cunning plan
that will doom all to the day

====================
show me the love, the passion
make love in your lust, take me away
show me the love, the passion
make love in your eyes, behold the fire
show me the love, the passion
make love in your eyes, behold the fire
show me the love, the passion
make love in your eyes, behold the fire
show me the love, the passion
make love in your eyes, behold the fire
show me the love, the passion
the fire is burning bright as white
and all the people have died
and all the fires are burning bright as white
in the heat of the night, you cannot see
your reflection is changing
you can't hide your feelings
you are free, you are a fugitive
in the blazing sun
the future's in the skies above
the past is just beginning
you cannot flee your world
eternal space and time
you cannot escape me
as the serpent is pulling at my silk fur
my reflection is changing my mind
you cannot run from it
and so i run to the hills
and the hills they beckon my child
look to me and you will tremble as i approach
four leagues and ten and the storm
====================
