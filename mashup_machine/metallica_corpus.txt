master! master! new blood joins this earth and quickly hes subdued
through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules
with time the child draws in this whipping boy done wrong
deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on
hes known, ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day
his will theyll take away, yeah
what ive felt, what ive known
never shined through in what ive shown
never be, never see
wont see what might have been
what ive felt, what ive known
never shined through in what ive shown
never free, never me
so i dub thee "unforgiven"
they dedicate their lives to running all of his
he tries to please them all this bitter man he is
throughout his life the same, hes battled constantly
this fight he cannot win, a tired man they see no longer cares

drifting further every day
getting lost within myself
nothing matters, no one else
i have lost the will to live
simply nothing more to give
there is nothing more for me
need the end to set me free
things not what they used to be
missing one inside of me
deathly loss, this cant be real
cannot stand this hell i feel
emptiness is filling me
to the point of agony
growing darkness taking dawn
i was me, but now hes gone
no one but me can save myself, but its too late
now i cant think... think why i should even try
yesterday seems as though it never existed
death greets me warm, now i will just say goodbye
goodbye... make his fight on the hill in the early day
constant chill deep inside
shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
on the fight, for theyre right, yes, but whos to say?
for a hill, men would kill, why? they do not know
stiffened wounds test their pride
men of five still alive through the raging glow
gone insane from the pain that they surely know
for whom the bell tolls
time marches on
for whom the bell tolls
take a look to the sky just before you die
its the last time you will
blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky
shattered goal fill his soul with a ruthless cry
stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
hears the silence so loud
crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

better raise your ears
the sound of hooves knock at your door
lock up your wife and children now
its time to wield the blade
for now youve got some company
the horsemen are drawing nearer
on the leather steeds they ride
theyve come to take your life
on through the dead of night
with the four horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die
aw yeah, yeah!
youve been dying since the day you were born
you know its all been planned
the quartet of deliverance rides
a sinner once a sinner twice
no need for confession now
cause now you have got the fight of your life
the horsemen are drawing nearer
on the leather steeds they ride
theyve come to take your life
on through the dead of night
with the four horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die
aw yeah, yeah!
time! has taken its toll on you
the lines that crack your face
famine! your body, it has torn through
withered in every place
pestilence! for what youve had to endure
and what you have put others through
death! deliverance for you for sure
now theres nothing you can do
so gather round, young warriors now
and saddle up your steeds
killing scores with demon swords
nows the death of doers of wrong
swing the judgment hammer down
safely inside armor blood guts and sweat
the horsemen are drawing nearer
on the leather steeds they ride
theyve come to take your life
on through the dead of night
with the four horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die
aw yeah, yeah! on a long and lonesome highway east of omaha
you can listen to the engines moaning out its one old song
you can think about the woman, or the girl you knew the night before
but your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
when you are riding sixteen hours and theres nothing much to do
you dont feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through
but here i am, on the road again
there i am, up on the stage
there i go, playing the star again
there i go, turn the page
so you walk into this restaurant, strung out from the road
and you feel the eyes upon you, as youre shaking off the cold
you pretend it doesnt bother you, but you just want to explode
and most times you cant hear them talk, other times you can
all the same old cliches: is it woman? is it man?
and you always seem outnumbered, you dont dare make a stand, make your stand
but here i am, on the road again
there i am, up on the stage
here i go, playing the star again
there i go, turn the page
out there in the spotlight, youre a million miles away
every ounce of energy, you try to give away
and the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
with the echoes of the amplifiers, ringing in your head
you smoke the days last cigarette, remembering what she said
what she said
but here i am, on the road again
there i am, up on the stage
here i go, playing the star again
there i go, turn the page
there i go, turn that page
there i go, yeah, there i go, yeah
there i go, yeah, here i go
there i go, there i go
and im gone guilty as charged, but damn, it aint right
theres someone else controlling me
death in the air, strapped in the electric chair
this cant be happening to me
who made you god to say
"ill take your life from you?"
flash before my eyes
now its time to die
burning in my brain
i can feel the flame
wait for the sign to flick the switch of death
its the beginning of the end
sweat, chilling cold, as i watch death unfold
consciousness, my only friend
my fingers grip with fear
what am i doing here?
flash before my eyes
now its time to die
burning in my brain
i can feel the flame
someone help me
oh please, god, help me!
theyre trying to take it all away
i dont want to die

someone help me
oh please, god, help me!
theyre trying to take it all away
i dont want to die
time moving slow, the minutes seem like hours
the final curtain call i see
how true is this? just get it over with
if this is true, just let it be
wakened by a horrid scream
freed from this frightening dream
flash before my eyes
now its time to die
burning in my brain
i can feel the flame born to push you round
better just stay down
you pull away, he hits the flesh, you hit the ground
mouth so full of lies
tend to black your eyes
just keep them closed, keep praying, just keep waiting
waiting for the one
the day that never comes
when you stand up and feel the warmth
but the son shine never comes, no
no, the son shine never comes
push you cross that line
just stay down this time
hide in yourself, crawl in yourself, youll have your time
god, ill make them pay
take it back one day
ill end this day, ill splatter color on this gray
waiting for the one
the day that never comes
when you stand up and feel the warmth
but the son shine never comes, no
love is a four letter word
and never spoken here
love is a four letter word
here in this prison
i suffer this no longer
ill put an end to this, i swear
this, i swear, the son will shine
this, i swear! this, i swear!
this! i! swear! how could he know this new dawns light
would change his life forever?
set sail to sea but pulled off course
by the light of golden treasure
was he the one causing pain
with his careless dreaming?
been afraid, always afraid
of the things hes feeling
he could just be gone
he would just sail on
he would just sail on
how can i be lost
if ive got nowhere to go?
searched for seas of gold
how come its got so cold?
how can i be lost?
in remembrance i relive
how can i blame you
when its me i cant forgive?
these days drift on inside a fog
its thick and suffocating
this seeking life outside its hell
inside intoxicating
hes run aground, like his life
waters much too shallow
slipping fast, down with the ship
fading in the shadows
now a castaway
theyve all gone away
theyve gone away
how can i be lost
if ive got nowhere to go?
searched for seas of gold
how come its got so cold?
how can i be lost?
in remembrance i relive
how can i blame you
when its me i cant forgive?
forgive me
forgive me not
forgive me
forgive me not
forgive me

no one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
victim of what said should be, a servant til i fall
soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
twenty-one, only son, but he served us well
bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
finished here, greeting death, hes yours to take away
back to the front
you will do what i say, when i say
back to the front
you will die when i say, you must die
back to the front
you coward, you servant, you blind man
barking of machine-gun fire, does nothing to me now
sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
more a man, more stripes you wear, glory seeker trends
bodies fill the fields i see, the slaughter never ends
soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
twenty-one, only son, but he served us well
bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
finished here, greeting death, hes yours to take away
back to the front
you will do what i say, when i say
back to the front
you will die when i say, you must die
back to the front
you coward, you servant, you blind man
why am i dying?

lie! live off lying
hell! hell is here
why am i dying?
kill! have no fear
lie! live off lying
hell! hell is here
i was born for dying
life planned out before my birth, nothing could i say
had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
looking back i realize, nothing have i done
left to die with only friend, alone, i clench my gun
soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
twenty-one, only son, but he served us well
bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say

hello darkness, say goodbye
hello darkness, say goodbye
hello darkness, say goodbye do you see what i see?
truth is an offense
you silence for your confidence
do you hear what i hear?
doors are slamming shut
limit your imagination
keep you where they must
do you feel what i feel?
bittering distress
who decides what you express?
do you take what i take?
endurance is the word
moving back instead of forward
seems to me absurd
doesnt matter what you see
or into it what you read
you can do it your own way
if its done just how i say
independence limited
freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
freedom of speech is words that they will bend
freedom with their exception
do you fear what i fear?
living properly
truths to you are lies to me
do you choose what i choose?
more alternatives
energy derives from both
the plus and negative
do you need what i need?
boundaries overthrown
look inside, to each his own
do you trust what i trust?
me, myself and i
penetrate the smoke screen
i see through the selfish lie
doesnt matter what you see
or into it what you read
you can do it your own way
if its done just how i say
independence limited
freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
freedom of speech is words that they will bend
freedom with their exception

do you know what i know?
your money and your wealth
you silence just to hear yourself
do you want what i want?
desire not a thing
i hunger after independence
lengthen freedoms ring
doesnt matter what you see
or into it what you read
you can do it your own way
if its done just how i say
independence limited
freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
freedom of speech is words that they will bend
freedom no longer frees you
doesnt matter what you see
or into it what you read
you can do it your own way
if its done just how i say mama she has taught me well
told me when i was young
"son, your lifes an open book
dont close it fore its done"
"the brightest flame burns quickest"
is what i heard her say
a sons hearts owned to mother
but i must find my way
let my heart go
let your son grow
mama, let my heart go
or, let this heart be still (be still)
"rebel," my new last name
wild blood in my veins
apron strings around my neck
the mark that still remains
left home at an early age
of what i heard was wrong
i never asked forgiveness
but what is said is done
let my heart go
let your son grow
mama, let my heart go
or, let this heart be still
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
so let this heart be still
mama, now im coming home
im not all you wished of me
but a mothers love for her son
unspoken, help me be
i took your love for granted
and all the things you said to me, yeah-yeah
i need your arms to welcome me
but a cold stones all i see
let my heart go
let your son grow
mama, let my heart go
or, let this heart be still
let my heart go
mama, let my heart go
you never let my heart go
so, let this heart be still
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
so, let this heart be still do unto others as theyve done to you
but what the hell is this world coming to?
blow the universe into nothingness
nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest

fight! mama, they try and break me
the window burns to light the way back home
a light that warms, no matter where theyve gone
theyre off to find the hero of the day
but what if they should fall by someones wicked way?
still the window burns
time so slowly turns
and someone there is sighing
keepers of the flames
do you feel your name?
did you hear your babies crying?
mama, they try and break me
still they try and break me
excuse me while i tend to how i feel
these things return to me that still seem real
now, deservingly, this easy chair
but the rocking stopped by wheels of despair
dont want your aid
but the fist i make
for years cant hold or feel
no, im not all me
so please excuse me while i tend to how i feel
but now the dreams and waking screams
that ever last the night
so build the wall, behind it crawl
and hide until its light
so can you hear your babies crying now?
still the window burns
time so slowly turns
and someone there is sighing
keepers of the flames
did you feel your names?
did you hear your babies crying?
but now the dreams and waking screams
that ever last the night
so build a wall, behind it crawl
and hide until its light
so cant you hear your babies crying now?

mama, they try and break me
mama, they try and break me
mama, they try and break me
mama, they try
mama, they try... fortune, fame
mirror vain
gone insane
but the memory remains
heavy rings on fingers wave
another star denies the grave
see the nowhere crowd, cry the nowhere tears of honor
like twisted vines that grow
hide and swallow mansions whole
dim the light of an already faded prima donna
fortune, fame
mirror vain
gone insane
fortune, fame
mirror vain
gone insane
but the memory remain
heavy rings hold cigarettes
up to lips that time forgets
while the hollywood sun sets behind your back
and cant the band play on?
just listen, they play my song
ash to ash
dust to dust
fade to black
fortune, fame
mirror vain
gone insane
fortune, fame
mirror vain
gone insane
dance little tin goddess
drift away

grab this life and walk away
war is never done
rub the patch and battle on
make it go away
please, make it go away
confusion
all sanity is now beyond me
delusion
all sanity is but a memory
my life, the war that never ends
leave the battlefield
yet its horrors never heal
coming home from war
pieces dont fit anymore
make it go away
please, make it go away
confusion
all sanity is now beyond me
delusion
all sanity is but a memory
my life, the war that never ends
father, please come home
shell shocked all ive known
father, please come home
label him a deadwood soldier now
cast away and left to roam
rapid is the road to sacrifice
just takes longer to come home
come home
confusion
all sanity is now beyond me
delusion
crossfire ricochets inside me
trapped in a memory forever
my life, the war that never ends like a siren in my head that always threatens to repeat
like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding drivers seat
like a face that learned to speak, when all it knew was how to bite
like a misery that keeps me focused though ive gone astray
like an endless nightmare i must awaken from each day
like conviction, a premonition not worthy of, so i deny
i blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
i stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
i blind my eyes, i hide and feel it passing me by
i open just in time to say goodbye
almost like your life, almost like your endless fight
curse the day is long, realize you dont belong
disconnect somehow, never stop the bleeding now
almost like your fight, and there it went almost like your life
like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
like a raging river, drowning when i only need a drink
like a poison that i swallow, but i want the world to die
like a release from a prison that i didnt know i was in
like a fight to live the past i prayed to leave from way back then
like a general without a mission until the war would start again
start again
i blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
i stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
i blind my eyes, i hide and feel it passing me by
i open just in time to say goodbye
almost like your life, almost like your endless fight
curse the day is long, realize you dont belong
disconnect somehow, never stop the bleeding now
almost like your fight, and there it went almost like your life
like a touch from hell to feel how hot
that it can get if you get caught
like a strike from heaven that turns that key
that brings you straight down to your knees
like a touch from hell to feel how hot
that it can get if i get caught
like a strike from heaven to reprieve
that brings you straight down to your knees
almost like your life, almost like your endless fight
curse the day is long, realize you dont belong
disconnect somehow, never stop the bleeding now
almost like your fight, and there it went almost like your life
that was just your life there is a devil waiting outside your door (how much longer?)

another sorrow, another breath
no remorse, no repent

another sorrow, another breath

no remorse, no repent
we dont care what it meant
another day, another death
another sorrow, another breath
no remorse, no repent
we dont care what it meant
another day, another death
another sorrow, another breath
attack!
bullets are flying, people are dying
with madness surrounding, all hells breaking loose
soldiers are hounding, bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
with war machines going, blood starts to flowing
no mercy given to anyone here
the furious fighting, swords are like lightning
it all becomes frightening, you know death is near
no remorse no more!
the crap rolls out of your mouth again
havent changed, your brain is still gelatin
little whispers circle around your head
why dont you worry about your self instead?
who are you? where you been? where you from?
gossip burning on the tip of your tongue
you lie so much, you believe yourself
judge not lest ye be judged yourself
holier than thou
you are
holier than thou
you are
you know not
before you judge me, take a look at you
cant you find something better to do?
point the finger, slow to understand
arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand
its not who you are, its who you know
others lives are the basis of your own
burn your bridges and build them back with wealth
judge not lest ye be judged yourself
holier than thou
you are
holier than thou
you are
you know not
yeah! who the hell are you?!?

holier than thou
you are

(disappear) sound is ripping through your ears
the deafening sound of metal nears
bodies waiting for his whips
the taste of leather on your lips
hear the cry of war, louder than before
with his sword in hand to control the land
crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
fall on to your knees for the phantom lord
victims falling under chains
you hear them crying dying pains
the fist of terrors breaking through
now theres nothing you can do
hear the cry of war louder than before
with his sword in hand to control the land
crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
fall on to your knees for the phantom lord

the leathered armies have prevailed
the phantom lord has never failed
smoke is lifting from the ground
the rising volume metal sound
hear the cry of war louder than before
with his sword in hand to control the land
crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
fall on to your knees for the phantom lord
fall to your knees
and bow to the phantom lord! thunder and lightning, the gods take revenge
senseless destruction
victims of fury are cowardly now
running for safety
stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
leaving the virgin
suicide running as if it were free
ripping and tearing
oh, through the mist and the madness
were trying to get the message to you
metal militia
metal militia
metal militia
chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
join or be conquered the law of the land
what will befall you
the metalization of your inner soul
twisting and turning
oh, through the mist and the madness
were trying to get the message to you
metal militia
metal militia, oh!
we are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
spreading the message to everyone here
come let yourself go
oh, through the mist and the madness
were trying to get the message to you

turning it into your prison cell
advantages are taken, not handed out
while you struggle inside your hell
(reaching out) reaching out
grabbing for something you have got to feel
(closing in) closing in
the pressure upon you is so unreal
(struggle within) it suits you fine
(struggle within) your ruin

all reflections look the same
in the shine of the midnight revolver
all hide beneath a skin
a hope so paper thin
im at the door again
and the shine of the midnight revolver
even the promise of danger has gone dull
staring down the barrel of a 45
suck on the barrel
suck on the barrel
suck it until its gone dry
for all reflections look the same
in the shine of the midnight revolver
redemption purify
will nothing satisfy
the scars just multiply
in the shine of the midnight revolver
twisting in apocalypse
death upon the fingertips
frigid metal touches lips
and the shine of the midnight revolver
because you lied
just a bullet away
just a bullet away from leaving you
just a bullet away
stop the voices in my head
caressing death again
becomes the heroin
forbidden medicine
puts a shine on the midnight revolver
eternal borderline
all the faces intertwine
oh god... now i see mine
in the shine of the midnight revolver
down in misery
down in misery

shes wretched, but she comforts me
and after everyone goes home
shes always there for me
and when the sun goes hell-bound
and the moon does resurrect the night
i will hide within her
not much good has come out the light
after everyone goes home
and im left here on my own
i will, run straight to hell and back
straight to hell and back
when they turn out all their lights
and im left to brood at night
always, return to hell and back
straight to hell and back
straight down, yeah
a lonely light in a window
just longing for some company
tragic, heartless, and hateful
but theres nothing as willing as she
and when the night has fallen
it falls hard and then it all begins
when she starts her calling
i feel my darkness growing from within
after everyone goes home
and im left here on my own
i will, run straight to hell and back
straight to hell and back
when they turn out all their lights
and im left to brood at night
always, return to hell and back
straight to hell and back
straight to hell and back
i will, run straight down to hell and back

unbridled, unequal
unholy, undone
the path is cut deep
the path is worn well
i follow my footsteps
to the warmth of hell
the warmth of hell

after everyone goes home
and im left here on my own
i will, run straight to hell and back
straight to hell and back
straight to hell and back
when they turn out all their lights
and im left to brood at night
always, return to hell and back

and i know, yeah yeah yeah sound of gunfire comes through the night
killing and hatred, it is a terrible sight
reports come in of the heavy attack
message is seen, we are moving back
preparations are made for the journey back
it is a survival, supplies are packed
no more nights in this eternal hell
destination is simple, we move out
killing time - you left from the line
killing time - your turn to kill
killing time - what do you say
killing time
and he knew what he needed to keep us alive
no time for cowardice, kill and survive
like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
nasty word, he will take your life
the silence is over, they attack again
killing and hatred drive me insane
reports come in of a heavy attack
message is seen, we are moving back hey babe dont act so scared
all i want is some special care
on the run from some institution
all i want is some constellation
and i can tell by his face
i am a total disgrace
put me inside this place
move over for a damage case
hey baby wait a minute, stop
dont run away, dont call a cop
i am not looking to victimize you
all i want to do is tantalize you
i can tell by your face

i can tell by his face
move over for a damage case
get the fuck over man opposition - contradiction
premonition - compromise
agitation - violation
masturbation... on our face
darkest color: blistered earth... true death of life
never hunger - never prosper
i have fallen prey to failure...
struggle within triggered again
now the candle burns at both ends...
halls of justice painted green, money talking
power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
soon youll please their appetite, they devour
hammer of justice crushes you, overpower
the ultimate in vanity
exploiting their supremacy
i cant believe the things you say
i cant believe, i cant believe the price you pay
nothing can save you
justice is lost - justice is raped - justice is gone
pulling your strings... justice is done
seeking no truth - winning is all
find it so grim, so true, so real
apathy, their stepping stone, so unfeeling
hidden, deep animosity, so deceiving
thru your eyes, their light burns, hoping to find
inquisition sinking you with prying minds
the ultimate in vanity
exploiting their supremacy
i cant believe the things you say
i cant believe, i cant believe the price you pay
nothing can save you
justice is lost - justice is raped - justice is gone
pulling your strings... justice is done
seeking no truth - winning is all
find it so grim, so true, so real
blackened is the end - winter it will send
throwing all you see into obscurity
death of mother earth - never a rebirth
evolutions end - never will it mend... never
fire, to begin whipping dance of the dead
blackened is the end
to begin whipping dance of the dead
color our world blackened
fire is the outcome of hypocrisy
darkest potency
in the exit of humanity
color our world blackened! blackened! only way to feel the noise
is when it is good and loud
so good i cant believe it
screaming with the crowd

in the great magnetic field
where he traveled time
for the future of mankind

he just stares at the world
planning his vengeance
that he will soon unfold
now the time is here
for iron man to spread fear
vengeance from the grave
kills the people he once saved
nobody wants him
they just turn their heads
nobody helps him
now he has his revenge

constant chill deep inside
shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
on they fight, for theyre right

were gonna play back

some of the bands new songs.

therell be no cameras allowed
in there.

therell be no video,
no bags in there.

you can only walk in
with paper and a pencil.

- were ready.
- are there any questions?

you want a single?

camera over here.

was there ever a moment you
thought about stopping with metallica

or the whole band was falling apart?

was it a kind of a power struggle
between you and him?

how did you manage
to solve this crisis?

where in gods name are you
getting this aggression from

on this new album?
wheres it coming from?

why did it take so long to release
an album with the new songs?

after    years,
is it possible to retain the fire

that, you know, you guys once had
at the beginning?

do you think the young generation of
metal fans will accept the new album?

eighty-five million records,    years.

i think its    albums
and various official releases.

one word.

oh, my god.

one word to span our career?

we are scanning the scene
in the city tonight

were looking for you
to start up a fight

there is an evil feeling in our brains

but its nothing new
you know it drives us insane

running, on our way
hiding, you will pay

dying,      deaths

running, on our way
hiding, you will pay

thank you!

after    years of headbanging,
metallica bassist jason newsted

has quit the band, citing:

"private and personal reasons
and the physical damage that ive done

to myself over the years
while playing the music i love."

metallicas management had no
comment when asked by mtv news

if theres a replacement
waiting in the wings.

but the band is still scheduled to begin
recording a new album this spring.

thats the news for now.
stay tuned for more news.

i mean, i think everybody understands
the concept of trusting instincts.

thats getting to a place where
you dont let egos and let stuff

get in the way of artistic expression.
you know?

i mean, do you wanna say more?
i think everybody understands...

i met metallica through
q prime management,

after having seen me work
with another band of theirs,

when they called
and said that metallica,

with jason announcing
that he was exiting the group,

needed to take a look
at itself and say:

"well, whats going on here? weve lost
touch with our personal relationships,"

and face some of the issues that i think
q prime felt that they were headed for.

you know, we havent really worked
together for almost nine months.

when we were talking a couple
of days ago about whether--

you know, if we wanted
to do this film or not,

i was wondering if having these
guys in here would affect that.

because im just--
theres an intimacy that you get

when its just a few people
in the room,

and im just wondering
if thats gonna get lost,

if were gonna go back
to sort of, like,

battling each other and trying
to be, like, all strong and--

what intimacy?
what the fuck are you talking about?

i think, to me, its not gonna
be a matter of whether

the cameras are in play,

but whether or not you guys
are free enough

to risk being seen by other people.

were here in the presidio
in san francisco,

and this is gonna be the location
where metallica

is gonna start recording
their next album.

we decided that we didnt wanna
go back into a studio again

and do kind of, like, the same thing
we had done before.

we had to kind of change things up.

and this is one of the things
that we talked about,

was to go into a space
thats not a studio,

bring in kind of, like, a portable studio
or a makeshift studio,

and basically make
the situation uncomfortable.

you know, dont buy new furniture,
dont paint the walls.

dont do anything.
just keep it spartan, keep it crude.

theyre such a success
that you can get comfortable.

i dont think they wanna be
comfortable.

theres definitely a vibe in here.

they got a lot of attitude,
and i think they want it

to come out on this next album.

how did you approach
this record differently?

did you talk about things, did you
have ideas, keywords, things like that,

that you wanted to put across
before you started

putting the whole thing together?

well, ego was a big one.
coming in here

and not bringing a riff,
not bringing a song,

not bringing a title. nothing.

me and james did not meet
somewhere else

and come in here with material,
with songs, with music.

this time we all got in a room
and just started playing.

and thats how we wrote songs.

the idea is it should
sound like a band getting together

in a garage for the first time.

only the bands metallica.

i really like going fast.

just go off and meditate
in the wind, you know.

as corny as it sounds, it works,
and it feels good.

its a good way to just let the weight
of the world off every once in a while.

it is-- it is kind of strange being,
you know,

like, a famous guy. you know.

this is-- this is part of me
thats trying to be unfamous, i guess.

but its also
go-against-the-rules attitude.

you know, is this a big pose?
i mean, yes, this is a pose.

i mean, am i driving down the street
to not get noticed in this thing?

i mean, "rebellious" is kind of
what this says, i would say.

- have you got a plug-in here?
- wait.

so, what exactly are you doing?

well, youll just hold it
above the pickups.

oh, okay. i got you.

yeah!

give me fuel, give me fire
give me that which i desire

i got some bad news.
gonna have to--

change the lyrics?

i like this thing, bob.

- what?
- i like this thing.

i used to kid myself that art was
my great escape away from music.

and i think ive become
increasingly aware

that my interest in art, music
and metallica

is not separate from anything.

you know, where does he feel
that theres enough

of that kind of gold thing?

how come there isnt
another    strokes

up in that black area up there,
where its kind of bare?

where are the starting points
and the end points,

if you know what i mean?
whens a song done?

what the fuck does
that mean, anyway? done.

whens a record done?

you know, where does a record start?
where does it end?

where does the process start?
where does the process end?

all that type of stuff.
do you know what i mean?

- daddy!
- its really interesting.

yes, sweetie.

i dont feel anything great there.

i dont think
its that great of a riff either.

- how do you hear the riff then?
- i like that:

and then:

yeah.

in nine days, itll be
my two-year anniversary of surfing.

its taken the place of a lot
of bad things in my life.

so i basically stopped doing
the drugs that i was doing

and cut way back on my drinking.

you cant surf
when youre hung-over.

you cant surf if youve been up
all night. well, at least i cant.

theres a sort of individualism,
also, about surfing that i like.

i mean, when its your moment, man,
thats your moment and yours alone.

and no one can help you.

for all intents and purposes, we go
into this record completely equal.

everybody contributing

just as much on the lyric front
as james contributing

with drum parts and...

as soon as you started talking
about that, i just like...

yeah. yeah. you flash back now.

well...

you wanna hear it with vocals?

go sing it.

you guys had some rules
about that before.

quite frankly, i dont give a fuck.
im tired of arguing.

you couldnt talk about his lyrics,

therefore, he couldnt talk about
your drumming.

- right.
- do you know what i mean?

and you and him did the solos,

so you werent allowed to comment
on the solos.

do you know what i mean?
there was, like, rules.

are you telling me that
those boundaries are gone now?

in the past, what we did was

started with a bunch of ideas existing
on tape from everybody.

then me and james would sit down
and turn those ideas into songs.

and then we would tell the rest
of the band what to play

and when to play
and how to play it.

there was never any,
just, other ways of doing it.

you know, its a whole new thing
for me.

you know, writing in front
of everybody,

because ive always just gone
into my own head

and wrote stuff down,
instead of taking things from outside

and putting them down.

what i was thinking is, is like--
"these are the hands that--"

"this is the face that--"
so its, like--

building a frankenstein
or something?

- yeah. pretty much.
- building what?

- "this is the top of my head thats flat."
- a frankenstein.

"these are my bolts..."

were on the same
stream of consciousness here.

were just all working
on the same creative wavelength.

and its inspiring to me.

now i can further express myself
with these lyrics

now that, you know, james has
opened that door for lars and i.

- this is "clay," right?
- yeah.

- not "clam."
- clay.

"these hands finger the clam."

these are the eyes
that cant see through me

this is the tongue
that speaks on the inside

make sure you really, like,
spit "cant see me."

these are the eyes
that cant see me!

these are the eyes
that cant see me

these are the hands
that drop your trust

- "this is the--"
- yeah.

this is the eye--
yeah.

this is the eye
that cant see me

this is the hand
that drops your trust

these are the boots
that kick you around

this is the voice of silence no more

- what is this about?
- well, i mean, i said frankenstein.

its not that far off,
talking about pieces of things.

so, i mean, some kind of monster.

some kind of monster?

- you know?
- some kind of monster.

- it is-- it is good.
- you know what i mean?

i like that.

some kind of monster

some kind of monster

the monster lives

"we come now to create
our album of life.

throughout our individual
and collective journeys,

sometimes through pain and conflict,

weve discovered the true meaning
of family.

as we accomplish ultimate
togetherness,

we become healers of ourselves

and the countless who embrace us
and our message.

we have learned,
and we understand.

now we must share."

- so thats just--
- a mission statement.

- a what statement?
- mission statement.

- mission?
- yeah, mission.

- its like-- you know, it sets a goal,
- right.

so you just can, like, just always be
reminded of, you know--

you know, what the ultimate goal is.

all right.

its my world, you cant have it
its my world, you cant have it

its my world, you cant have it

its my world, my world
you cant have it

sucker!

excellent.

come on, little man. lets go.

skylar, do you want your purse?

- daddy.
- ill come. ill come.

come, daddy. come, daddy.

i dont know how you guys feel, but
its really awesome what were doing.

the four of us can just go
in a fucking room

and roll that kind of shit
out of our sleeves.

pull it out of thin air, man.

its so exciting, because
that has just never happened before.

i couldnt get to sleep last night,
because i was still wired from it all.

how do you feel? you dont
seem really psyched about it.

what the hell.

- hows it going? good to see you.
- yeah, thank you.

- how many bears did you kill?
- two.

russias fucked up.
you know, it was like,

you put a bottle of water here
on the table.

that was it,
a bottle of vodka sitting there.

- did you drink vodka?
- hell, yeah.

- you did?
- what else is there to drink?

as soon as you got there,
it was like, "na zdoroviya!"

na zdoroviya!

thats a pretty big bear.

- is bear edible?
- they were no good to eat.

that freaked me out when
they didnt take any meat.

you know, they have been hibernating
for three months,

so they havent pissed or shit
or nothing.

- oh, so theyre toxic?
- yeah.

third day, i killed my bear,

and i was just in camp
for the rest of the time.

i was like, "oh, my god."

- worked on lyrics?
- yeah. i actually did.

that was a lot of time, man.

a lot of time.

i worked on lyrics in siberia.

how to drink vodka
and work on lyrics.

temptation
wreck my head

temptation
make you dead

temptation
sucks my soul

temptation
fill no hole

temptation

fuck you up
temptation

no, no, no, no
i cant say no

cant say no
no

no
no, no, no

cant say no

oh, no
i cant say no

go away

leave me be

just leave me be

so, what were the reactions you got
from those close?

i mean, how did the family react?

im just-- i dont know.
sometimes im a real ass about it

and just come in and say,
"oh, by the way,

im going to russia for two weeks
right here."

you know, and, "what?" you know.

yeah, im getting better at that,
you know,

because that was the most
i missed my family ever.

- you know?
- right.

and it was, you know,
castors first birthday i missed.

- right.
- and it was--

of course, we had a little vodka
to castor.

did a little shot for him
and everything.

but i wouldve loved to have
been able to get ahold of home.

whos here?

this is daddy working.

- this is where dad works?
- yeah.

- what does your dad do for work?
- drums.

- he plays drums?
- yeah.

- let me play drums.
- is he good at it?

- daddy, wanna play drums?
- i played drums a lot today already.

im okay. you play for a while.

- those guys,
- thats very good.

you know, their plate is filled
with many, many things.

and music is just one of the things.

- say, "bye, james."
- bye, james.

bye, buddy.

i chose not to have children
and do those kind of things.

my music, thats my children.
you know?

daddys gonna stay and work
for a little while.

but since i decided to do it
with music,

then thats what i have
to fill my time with.

echobrain is one of the projects
that ive been working on for years.

and now its come to fruition.

and then when it comes to the time
where my main cat, james,

tells me that basically
he couldnt be in a band with me

if i did the--
took this other project to this level.

and after    years of working
together and going on buses

and, you know, the stories, man...

there was no way that this thing
that i was doing

could affect the monster of metallica.
i just dont see how it could.

and so-- and saying things like that,

i couldnt accept that kind of

limited acceptance.

i also know that this relationship
is not over.

you know, hell-- itll come
around again at some point.

you guys will make contact.

at that time the managers suggested

that we have a psychotherapist
come in,

a man that meets
with pro-ball teams,

you know, big-ego, big-dollar guys
that cant get along

but have to make
some kind of entity flow

so everybody else and everybody
can make their money.

and i actually said:

"i think that this is
really fucking lame

and weak that we
cannot get together. us.

look, the biggest heavy band
of all time.

and the things weve been through,
and decisions weve made

about squillions of dollars
and squillions of people.

and this, we cant get over this?"

was it more than just
the echobrain thing?

because thats, like, you know,
what has been discussed.

he felt like he wasnt free enough
to do what he needed to do.

since he wasnt getting his creativity
out enough in metallica,

he needed to get it out
somewhere else.

and i totally understand that now.

and...

on my side of that was,

i didnt want him to enjoy that
more than metallica.

i didnt want anyone
to leave metallica.

i didnt want to feel
that we werent enough

or something like that.

and it was-- through my--

i guess the way i learned how
to love things

was just to choke them to death.

you know?
"dont go anywhere. dont leave."

you know?
"you have to stay here."

okay.

need a pen, none of this pencil shit.

check it out, man,
he cant even fucking spell it right.

"metllica."
weve only been together    years.

i feel guilty that im not inspired
all the time.

you know, especially
when everyone else is.

its like, "okay."
we kind of get to the point

where the song is looped twice
in the pro tools,

and i know bobs gonna hit me up
for some kind of lyric ideas.

"oh, shit." i was, like,
dreading the whole process.

its like, "why are you dreading it?
why dont you just--?"

well, youre dreading it
because of what?

- lets get to the fear.
- well, because i didnt have anything.

- and so if you didnt have anything--
- wasnt inspired enough

to have something or letting down
the team or some vibe like that.

one, two, three, five.

say it, im lonely, yeah

motherfucking in my head

its like im almost,
like, racing against time.

theres, like, weird-ass fear of like:

"i gotta come up with something
myself really quick

before somebody else comes up
with something for me."

and then if i dont like it
or dont     percent embrace it,

then im just being a selfish,
you know, insular asshole.

its a fear response.
when were up against a fear,

thats the time to move into it,
forward.

because theres going to be
some kind of genius there

or some kind of breakthrough.

motherfucker, yeah

metallica. metallica.

kirk.

kirk.

kirk. kirk!

- kirk.
- kirk!

- kirk.
- kirk!

- yes.
- kirk.

- james is trying to talk to you.
- sorry, man.

yeah, its a bit stock.

check it out, guys.

i dont know how you feel.
im in a shit mood.

and im not digging it right now.

even last night, i gotta tell you,
everybody kind of looked--

i hate to tell you, looked pretty burnt.

i agree.

and if we dont start earlier
and end earlier, im just--

im not gonna be in a good mood
for the rest of this shit, you know?

that was totally weird for me.

you hear that, bob?

why dont you try getting
a more solid beat.

- regular.
- oh, well, you can call it regular.

- you called it regular.
- no, im trying not to call it regular,

because i know it bugs you
when i call it regular.

so a little more solid, then.

fuck!

maybe we should talk
about next week.

- well, all next week is therapy.
- yeah.

do we have to do that?
can we sack phil?

i mean, we gotta find--
we gotta find a balance to not--

you know, the phil stuffs important,

and i hope we all feel that thats
an investment in the music.

its an important part of the record.

get all holy again

let me just go put one together.

get all holy again

- its just real confusing sounding.
- its just jacking the vocals all up.

i mean-- i mean,
its clever and everything.

but, i mean, i dont see
what it does to the--

i think thats how you hear it, dude.
thats fine.

im just trying to do something
different.

i mean, im-- im used to having
the drummer do the beat part.

you know what i mean?
holding it together.

what im hearing is...

choose my words carefully here.

its pretty straightforward.
and the guitar shit, its--

you know, its a little stock.

so i started trying to introduce
some kind of edge to it on the drums.

those things we throw out
to each other are complete bullshit.

you know? "it sounds too stock.
it sounds too normal to me."

i mean--

you know what i mean?
youre saying this shit

so you can get your point across
about doing a drum beat.

i mean... you know,
it doesnt hold any water.

- to you.
- it doesnt.

i think its fucking stock. what--?
which part of that is unclear to you?

i think it sounds stock to my ears.

i mean, do you want me
to write it down? i think--

- oh, yeah, please write it down.
- it feels stock, okay?

- i cant hear you.
- so l--

no, when you say-- youre telling
me what to play, right now.

youre telling me, "you should
play with what kirks doing."

- and im telling you its stock.
- dude, fine.

you know what, you guys, why dont
we just go in and hammer it out,

all right, instead of hammering
on each other.

were in shit moods, and were not
gonna get anything done here today.

- all you wanna do is pick a fight.
- i dont wanna pick a fight.

this is so silly.
youre just sitting there going:

"im in a really pissy mood and--"

and i fucking told you
straight up that i was!

- right.
- and what are you trying to do?

im not trying to do fucking shit.

youre just sitting here
being a complete dick.

youre-- youre really helping matters.
youre really good at that.

i was straight up with you,
and i told you, im in a shit mood.

and what have you been doing?
fucking picking at me all night.

come on, guys.
weve got better things to do.

yeah, i do. i do.

metallica front man, james hetfield,
has entered a rehabilitation facility

to undergo treatment for alcoholism
and other undisclosed addictions.

in a statement posted
on metallicas official website,

the band writes, "james has entered
an undisclosed facility,

and he will continue to receive
treatment until further notice.

until then we have postponed
all current activities,

including recording sessions
for our new album."

metallica, whose hard-partying ways
earned them the nickname alcoholica,

have been working on their follow-up
to the      double disc...

i think its easy to see that,
in those days,

metallica brought a kind of
physicality to rock n roll.

lets say the beatles,
the rolling stones,

you know, and all that inspired
some of the british rock music

that then developed after that.

and lets say the metal music

and led zeppelin and black sabbath
and all of that.

and then, out of that again,
then, lets say,

then came lars
and all of that and being--

so i think that they have certainly
a place in all of that, i think.

lars had a very good vision
at the time

of where he saw that particular--

you know, the metal music going,
because he could see it

with european ears and eyes maybe.

dont you feel that its great for you

to have your fathers perspective on
who you are and what youre doing?

i think thats incredible.

you talk about the lineage...
which we did,

we talked a little bit
about your grandfather.

its very difficult to admit it,
especially with him standing next to me.

its easier to talk about it
when hes not in my presence.

but...
of course it is.

what would you--?
what would you say in private?

- to who?
- to anybody, without him here.

say it.
you know, what would it be?

well, i mean, ive already said it
to you countless times.

well, have you said it to him?

you brought it up. i didnt bring it up.

what is it you feel youve said
that youre not saying now?

i think maybe in some ways
some of the--

to me thats--

fear of status quo comes a little bit
from this direction over here.

i think that--
i mean, theres nothing worse

than when i have to go to him
and play the new record

and know theres something
on there that sucks.

and he can see right through that
in two and a half seconds flat.

comments on that one?

i would say, you know, if you said:

"if you were our adviser,
what would you say?"

then i would say, "delete that."

i mean-- i mean,
i dont know for you guys.

for me, it doesnt cut it.
you know?

- but--
- interesting. i mean, its interesting.

you know, now-- i mean, other
than the people involved here,

the only other people whove heard
any of this music is cliff burnstein.

when cliff burnstein heard that, he
thought that should open the record.

yeah. i mean, that could well be.

but im pretty sure that--

that i really-- that i really--
i really dont think so.

you know?
i really dont think so.

- right.
- for me, that--

that doesnt sound right
or something. you know?

unless im a guy
thats kind of shouting

in some kind of echo chamber.

so i think one
of our responsibilities here

is to act like a band
thats still continuing.

were going on.
were doing our exploring.

were exploring ourselves individually,
were exploring our relationships.

and we really need to get together,
talk about this,

act like the band exists,
because it does exist.

and if we dont do that,
then we are the coproducers

of the process slipping off the planet.

this is a bit
of a shit sandwich, though.

what does it--?
the unravelling of a band?

and then there were two?

so a good friend of mine
phoned me.

and he knew where james was.

- really?
- yeah.

he couldnt even imagine james
doing anything for six months.

im prepared for the worst.

im pretty confident that, you know,

we will come together
when the time is right.

but knowing when
that time will come,

or not knowing
when that time will come,

is very, very uncomfortable.

i hope that at some point
he will come back

and try and finish the making
of this record.

lf...

if he walked away from metallica,
im not sure

that it would surprise me.

say your prayers, little one

dont forget, my son
to include everyone

ive always felt that james
was a softer, more caring,

compassionate person than he
allowed himself to be to most people.

i can remember
from the dave mustaine days,

i mean, when him and dave mustaine,
these guys, they started right away

with their big, you know,
chests beating and their mannerisms,

and the whole thing was very much
about this kind of, like, macho--

it was just, like--
i couldnt deal with that stuff.

and looking back on, i mean,
what was that,       years ago,

i mean, i just felt so alienated,
because it was just so far removed

from the upbringing
that i come from.

well, heres to you, my friends.

but then, at the same time,
im starting to realizing now

that the sort of depressive things
that show up

as a result of the alcohol
and stuff like that,

it was just very difficult for him
to communicate from the heart.

- you want some or not?
- and not hide behind

a lot of these different fronts.

whether its alcohol, that gives
him a false sense of strength

or the front man in metallica

or, you know, macho bullshit
and all that stuff.

all right, now you guys are drunk,
and im drunk.

now this is the fun part, man.

i want to help him.
i want to be there for him.

and i want to do the best i can

to make him the best person
that he can be.

so i dont know how the fuck
its gonna play out.

its really healthy for me to be here
without any pressure

or anything related to the band

or anyone who would remind me
of the band.

and to recognize whats real.

our sessions with phil really stirred up
a lot of things in james

that he thought that he needed
to address.

mentally, its really taken--

taken its toll on myself, you know,
and im very worried about him.

and, you know, whenever
you check yourself into rehab,

they dont-- they dont focus on, you
know, the fact that youre an alcoholic.

they go much deeper, you know?
i mean, they go way deep.

they crack you open
and then spill you out

and examine all the things
that are on the table.

ive spoken to him a few times,

and, you know,
i know hes having a rough trip.

no matter how bad it gets, eventually
things seem to sort themselves out,

sooner or later.

whether its good or bad,
they sort themselves out.

i watched the people
around the world say

what a great guitar player kirk is

and what a piece of shit i am.
and that i got kicked out of metallica.

and i wasnt good enough for them.
and that i was a loser.

and ive had to deal with that
for almost    years.

its a dreadful experience.

its been hard, lars.

its been hard to watch everything that
you guys do and you touch turn to gold

and everything i do fucking backfire.

and im sure theres
a lot of people that

they would consider my backfire
complete success.

you know? and am i happy
being number two? no.

you know? youre just now
encountering something

ive been going
through       years.

ive never had a chance
to be able to tell you without

talking to lars, the guy in metallica.

never talked to my little danish
friend again. you know?

i remember the day you and i talked
about digging a hole in fucking dirt

and smoking hash
through the ground.

that to me is the stuff thats, like--

you know? and weve never had
very many moments like that.

do i feel some guilt? yes, i do.

but at the same time,
its difficult for me to comprehend

that the only thing that you feel

when you look back
on the last    years

is rooted in the metallica thing.

okay.

have you ever thought what--?
what ive been through?

i think ive had an awareness
of the pain i caused you.

thats not what i said.

okay.

do you have any idea--?

- of what i put you through.
- no, no, no, what i went through.

i mean, people hate me
because of you.

you know, i walk down the street,
and i hear some piece of shit

say "metallica" at me,
and they do that to taunt me.

i mean, when i would hear metallica
on the radio,

i would be like,
"god, i have to turn this off,"

because i just keep thinking,
"i fucked up!"

right.

ive been waiting for this day
for a long time.

you know? and by no means
is it done because

somebody else very important
is not here.

right.

do i wish it was      all over again,

and you guys woke me up and say:

"hey, dave, you know what?
you need to go to aa"? yeah.

id give anything for that chance.

is there any last words you wanna
say to everybody out there?

metal up your ass!

okay, thank you. this is donna davis,
and this is metallica.

this is, like, a pretty bitchin club
to play the first fucking gig.

- yeah.
- how do you guys feel?

- stoked.
- freaking out.

- freaking out?
- totally. totally.

its un-fucking-believable is what
it comes down to. can i say that?

- you can say whatever you want.
- its fucking unbelievable.

echobrain. yeah.

i dont know, i just-- all of a sudden
this became such a big production.

i dont understand.
its like all of a sudden, like--

i get one phone call, its like everybody
and their fucking brother are in town.

i thought itd be jason, like,
playing with his new band

in front of, you know, like,    drunks
down at some bar or something.

and now, i guess, to my own
ignorance or something, l--

thats what-- i guess thats
what i wanted it to be.

so now im realizing that supposedly
its a little more of a big deal than that.

- hey, whats happening, man?
- whats going on?

- sounded good, man. very good.
- thanks. thanks, man, thanks.

- awesome. awesome.
- oh, thanks. right on.

- im lars. how you doing?
- nice to meet you.

wheres jason?

- jas?
- i dont know.

i think he went back to--
i think he already fucking bailed.

- he went back to--
- really?

nice. go back to say hey,
and hes, like, fucking gone.

elvis has left the building.

theres zach. hey, zach.

see, hes even blowing me off.

jason blows me off.
zach blows me off.

how quick we become
yesterdays news.

no-- no kidding.

see, theres a guy
in an echobrain t-shirt.

yeah, thats steve over there.
he works at the studio with us.

well, he is.

- really?
- yeah.

i remember that guy.

i remember him.
he worked at the studio.

- which guy?
- over there.

- the guy in the red shorts?
- no, the guy in the black

thats walking across right now.
kessel.

todd. he works at the studio too,
doesnt he?

- who?
- todd over there.

im sure theyre all here, bob.

i mean, the only two people
in the bay area

not working for him is me and you.

hetfields gonna freak.

im in fucking hell.

this whole gig has brought
all of this on.

yes, it has.
its made me feel like--

- you really wanna come clean.
- it made me feel like such a loser.

i mean, i cant hold my band together,
you know.

i start records,
i dont finish them.

i fucking--

jason is the future.
metallicas the past.

ive never had a break like this
in    years.

do you know what i mean? and just--
whats been kind of getting me

is just not knowing.

you know what i mean? not knowing
and not hearing, it just eats away at you.

- kirk talked to him.
- i talked to james today.

what did he say?

he basically said that,
you know, he just--

his familys the priority right now,

and he needs time to work
on his family

before he can reach out
to his other family, being us.

and that he loves us,
and he just needs for us

to understand that he needs time.

and he also went on
about how difficult it was

talking to you about it,
because he felt pressured.

and, you know, he spoke
about how you always need

to be in control of the situation or in
control of the schedule or whatever.

and he said that this is a time

he needs complete control
of the situation.

and he said, you know, all the
marc reiters and the bob rocks,

all that stuff, you know, just has--
"i cant think of that right now."

so, you know, i got the feeling that
he kind of lumps in your relationship

with the business side of things,

which was actually
really surprising to me.

but i think thats--
you know, that explains--

i think that explains a lot
on why he hasnt spoken to you.

were just in limbo, and the longer
james chooses to stay away

from dealing with us,
the further we drift apart.

and i just feel so disrespected.

and thats the key thing.

was the future of the group
ever in doubt?

even when james went
into rehab, do you think?

lars and i, we were wondering

when james was going to finally feel
like he was in a situation

where he can come back
to the band.

and after a certain amount of months,
you know, lars and i started to think:

"well, is he ever gonna come back
to the band?"

and that was a really big question
on our plates.

whether or not, you know,
he wanted to come back.

james wrote something in the new
issue of our magazine, so what!

he wrote a kind of
a little handwritten note.

that note was probably
the most heartfelt thing

that id ever seen come
from his mind.

tomorrow is shaping up,
or is gearing itself up to be,

yes, the first sit-down
with one james hetfield post-rehab.

why are we filming this?

i dont know.

were in very different places.

or at least i am in a very different
place than i was from the presidio.

thats a huge understatement.

so we just have to find that if--

you know, if the movie will be
as intense, you know.

to me there was a lot of intrusion,

and i kind of went with it and felt--

i felt uncomfortable.
i felt uncomfortable with it.

you know, a boom
following me around,

and it just felt like i was
in the spotlight all the time.

and i didnt--
i guess i dont really like that feeling.

while we were in the presidio
filming you guys playing,

- did you feel it then too?
- yeah.

it was-- it was pretty much
all the time.

do you think youre
in a better place now?

- we gotta find some...
- im definitely in a better place.

some place that
makes you feel comfortable.

and the last thing we wanna do
is have it impede on your music,

because thats more important
than anything.

you know, one answer
may be there--

maybe there shouldnt be a film.

i mean, thats the range of possibilities
that we should really think about,

because, i mean,
why do you guys want a film?

even you said you hope
that the film is made. i mean--

thats a big question,
because, for me, it was really just--

it came along with being in metallica.

"hey, were gonna do this."
"oh, okay."

thats part of this, all of this...

the bigness of metallica,
and im kind of tired of it.

you might look at it as a friend.
to me, its been a beast.

and its sucked a lot of me into it.

you were maybe the keeper
of the beast at one point.

you know, because you were the
champion of that fifth-- that entity.

and, of course,
you gotta find the right balance

between what
everybodys personal needs are,

but if metallica collectively decides
to do this,

then i think metallica
can make it happen.

i dont know. that scares me again.

metallica is three individuals.

and three individuals have to decide
if its good to do.

but i still think that the priority
is the collective

until all the people involved
in the collective

say that the priority
is the individual.

and so far, youre the only one
that said the priority is the individual.

i havent said that.
he hasnt said that.

i havent heard him say that.

so i feel that its still--
theres still an unbalance there.

we met from, like, maybe,
i dont know, six or eight weeks

before we actually picked up
the project again.

that was when we came in,
and it was the first time

we actually used this studio, hq.

anyway, here we are. hq.

right on. well, were here.

and the cameras here.

and my friend the boom is here.

- hovering.
- yeah. cool.

do you want me to play the music?

yeah, lets go. im--

ill put the big speakers on.

i was afraid to pick up a guitar
and fearful of what would happen.

would i not like it? would i love it?

would i not be able to write
anything cool?

would i write just recovery stuff?

james.

it was probably the best sound
ive ever heard in my life,

just the fact that you
were playing guitar in here.

- hey, zach.
- right on, brother.

play a riff.

- what?
- nothing.

see? it feels pretty good, doesnt it?

- yeah.
- it feels like the next day.

a year later, the next day.

it will be interesting
working on this schedule,

because we really havent.
its gonna be great.

and kind of the overview is, you know,
the less time we have here,

the more productive well be,
in a way, you know?

its like were more focused
on getting the stuff done.

that all sounds really good.
okay. now, lets revisit it in a week.

so i think that, dont talk it, walk it.

at some point, we are gonna
have to work a little harder.

- yes.
- you know, when that feels right.

what do you mean?
what does that mean?

- what does that mean?
- yeah.

when you say harder,
does that mean more hours?

you know, if we can go deep
real quick,

be intense...

i spoke up because,
"what does that mean,

we have to, you know,
do eight hours now?"

- and i got fearful right then.
- thats okay.

i mean, its like... yeah.

- to do eight hours?
- no.

any lyric ideas?

im searching for--

searching for doughnuts.

- searching for doughnuts
- searching for doughnuts

what was the whole thing
from yesterday?

- the buddhist--
- guarantee-- what?

no, the buddhist thing that you had.

birth is pain, life is pain,
death is pain.

the cycle of suffering.
its called samsara.

where are you with this, james?

somewhere else.

wheres todays sweat going?

"ive worn out being afraid.
my endless parade

of fear that ive constantly made."

"my lifestyle determines
my deathstyle.

a rising tide that pushes
to the other side."

ive worn out being afraid
endless parade

of fear that ive constantly made

frantic tick tick tick tock
i gladly trade

oh, i need know the answer
where ill be laid

i cant find it

- it just-- it doesnt work.
- the great--

you did one great thing.
you went:

you did this one syncopated thing.

do the whole verse like that.

ive worn out always being afraid

an endless stream of fear
that ive made

frantic tick tick tock
ill gladly trade

its weird. its weird. and it works.

no, but the second time you felt
really comfortable with it.

- right.
- oh, by the way, its quarter to  .

i gotta get rolling, guys. sorry.

i feel like the bad guy saying,
"i gotta go because its  :  ."

if we all know, and we all do know,
that  :   is kind of the stop time,

then, i dont know, then i wont feel
like the heel here, saying:

"i gotta go eat dinner
with my kids," you know.

because i have a feeling
im gonna walk out of here,

and youre gonna go in there
and listen to this stuff,

- and its like, thats not right.
- thats not.

i mean, if i wanna listen to it,
ill go and listen to it.

but we should at least listen to it--

but i know youll sit there
and start talking with bob.

maybe bob doesnt wanna sit
in there, and when im gone,

things get talked about
and decisions are made.

and i feel i walk into something
thats already kind of decided.

and its a total uphill battle
for me a lot of times.

i dont like that feeling.

well, thats, like,
just like the last    years,

- yeah.
- for me.

well, lets talk about this
tomorrow, then, all right?

- or do you wanna take time out--?
- no, i dont have time right now,

because its past  .

its hard to introduce structure
into this, and im trying.

so, what do you think, lars?

can we hear the song
from yesterday?

that we all heard together?

how is that different?

because we all heard it
together already.

- he wants to be part of everything.
- was i in there?

yes, you were.
we all heard it together yesterday.

- you came in.
- all right.

as long as you dont talk about it.

- is that a way around it, or--?
- that is definitely a way around it.

how about if we just save up
the tension?

seriously. i mean, thats okay,
because tension produces results.

im excited to see
what you learned here.

up and back. up and freeze.

what is this called?

arabesque.

super proud of you, sweetie.

im so glad i got to see it.

im working on--
really hard, on being

the best dad and father
and husband i can be.

and the best me.

you worked hard.

i dont wanna lose
any of the stuff i have.

i know it could all go away
at one time,

and thats a tough part of life.

and then-- and its just--
its a total rebirth for me,

looking at life in a whole new way.

you know, all the other drinking and
all the other junk that i was stuck in,

it was so predictable, so boring.

im out there looking for excitement
in all this stuff.

the results are the same, man.

i wake up the next day somewhere
in some bed,

i dont know who this person
is next to me,

and im drunk, completely hung-over
and have a show to do.

and the result is the same.

you know?
when life now is pretty exciting.

you dont know
whats gonna happen

when youre kind of clear
and here and in the now.

in the moment.

my lifestyle determines
my deathstyle

a rising tide
that pushes to the other side

my lifestyle determines
my deathstyle

a rising tide
that pushes to the other side

i think those two feel the best to me.

its a tough one to decide.
they all kind of got

some charm, dont you think?

yeah, id be interested to hear
the first one.

from the first take.

well, lets play it.

- is it okay?
- are we allowed?

- yeah, we are.
- do we have--?

- we never really settled that, did we?
- we didnt settle it.

yes. were allowed.
well, id like to hear it.

feel free to leave the room, whoever
doesnt want to be part of that.

i felt like it was an agreement.
were gonna work from    to

and then we would not work.

well, if lars and i
listen to something

or go through the presidio stuff,

its not because we wanna do
something behind your back.

its for you.

and basically what i heard
is, "no, i cant do that."

- what the fuck is that?
- i dont know, my mind gets lopsided.

the more it goes in a different
direction, the harder it is.

the harder it is to get that back.

what is it you have to get back?

some control. some sense
of involvement in the band.

when i was running this morning,
i was thinking about seeing you today,

and the word "fuck"
just comes up so much.

seriously, its really true.

- is that in anger?
- no, just, "fuck!"

"fuck."

i just think youre
so fucking self-absorbed.

and what makes it worse is
that you always talk about...

you always talk about me.
you use the word "control"

and "manipulation" a lot.
i think you control on purpose,

and i think you control inadvertently.

i think you control by the rules
you always set.

i think you control by how you
always judge people.

i think you control by your absence.

i think you control all of this
even when youre not here.

i dont understand who you are.
i dont understand the program.

i dont understand all this stuff,
okay?

i realize now that i barely
knew you before.

and all these rules
and all this shit, man,

this is a fucking rock n roll band.

i dont want fucking rules.

i understand that you need
to leave at  .

i respect it.

but dont tell me i cant sit and listen to
something with bob at  :   if i want to.

what the fuck is that?

you know, i dont wanna end up
like jason, okay?

i dont want to be pushed away.
i dont want it to happen twice.

lets do it, and lets fucking do it
full-on or lets not do it at all.

fuck. see?

fuck.

fuck!

fuck!

yeah!

- yeah!
- metallica. yeah!

rock n roll.

lets hear it for elena!

were not anywhere near
getting any issues resolved.

well, lets get them.
thats what were here to do.

i dont know. i guess the playing part,
being in the room,

and then mainly being in the room
with lars, playing music together.

i guess i had higher expectations,
and i dont know,

maybe im disappointed in myself.

maybe... i dont know.

you wanna talk about that?
i mean, what does that mean?

im not enjoying being in the room
with you playing.

searching

seek and destroy

searching

seek and destroy

searching, yeah

seek and destroy

if you are not having any fun,

let me let it be known to you that
im not having a lot of fun either.

but ive-- i am not interested
in playing music with you

if youre not happy in there.

i just dont want to be a--
become a fucking parody.

okay? so if youre not happy
playing music with me:

is there enough that connects us
to hold on

for a way through this?

i dont know.

there are moments
where i really doubt it.

really doubt it.

im glad you said that.

because i really, deep down,
feel sometimes that its just...

theres just some empty, just...

just an ugly feeling inside.

just... i dont know.

how much work
do we gotta put into this?

- then youre doing the:
- yeah.

lets do our little roundtable thing
right now, quickly.

everybodys gotta participate.

lars, come on.

hey, castor, why dont you look at all
the boys-- the men, i should say.

and say bye to everybody.

bye, castor.
thank you for coming.

- is daddy going bye?
- no, your dadas staying here, okay?

- bye, guys.
- see you.

so, whats the deal? how does
everybody feel about what they heard?

the chorus lyrics will definitely work
in that feel.

- yeah.
- that kind of intro bit thats on there.

- what about you? what do you think?
- its good.

you think its good? was there
anything in particular that you...?

no, i wasnt paying attention
that detailed.

thats just-- its a lot of good stuff.

i can take you back, when me and him
were alone in my room, in

listening to the new wave of
british heavy-metal singles.

as soon as there was somebody else
in the room,

it just became this, like-- it just had
a very different energy to it.

- is there any of that thats usable?
- yeah.

- thats a fuck-- thats a fucking bitch.
- lets do another version of it, okay?

the first time i got
a real awareness of it

was when mustaine came
into the picture.

when james was with mustaine,

he became like he never
really cared about me.

one time during the recording
of the ride the lightning record,

where me and him went out and--
so    beers later,

it was like, "oh, dude, i love you."

but it could never have materialized
until it got to that   -beer point

and we were alone.

that was good.

are you sure i dont have
to play it again?

yeah, im sure.
its good practice, though.

- for what?
- the road.

- when?
- a couple years.

from day one, its been competitive.

and in a way, thats what has made
metallica what it is.

thats whats driven us further.

what feels good to you?

i dont know.
im gonna try a bunch more.

can you try maybe like a:

almost like a strum.

my parents split
when i was    or   .

and then my mom passed on
when i was   .

the only thing i felt that i really had,
at that point, was music.

my wanting to keep everything
under control,

and, you know, its out of a fear
of my abandonment issues.

im afraid to get close to people
because i dont know how to do it.

i dont know
how youre supposed to do it.

- cool.
- that last one was pretty good.

yes.

thats the first amp i ever owned.

that right there.

i think we have it.

okay.

okay. now we gotta talk about it.

you started talking about the idea of
the guitar solo, as we have known it,

maybe being something that was
a little outdated

and maybe reintroducing
some riff-o-rama things.

but can i say something
that i think is bullshit?

this whole fucking solo out,
you know, dates the whole thing.

thats so bullshit. you know?

if you put a guitar-- if you dont play
a guitar solo in one of these songs,

that dates it to this period.

and that cements it to a trend
thats happening in music right now.

i think thats stupid,
and i think its totally trendy.

i know thats not what i said.
its always been about,

like, where could it go
thats kind of new and interesting,

instead of just repeating
something from the past.

im not interested in playing
traditional guitar solos anymore.

- you know, thats just-- for me, its--
- and you told me that.

its just boring, you know.

to me, if you can add a colour
to the song

that satisfies you and works
for the song,

then thats what we should do with it.

but i dont wanna get in the position
where its like,

we put something down on the tape
to satisfy your ego,

my ego, lars ego or james ego.

i think it should serve
whats going down.

like, in other words, there shouldnt be,
like, a rule of no solos.

there shouldnt be a rule of solos.
it should be--

and i agree.
i mean, it really is, to me,

all about serving the song,
and, you know,

i feel much better about that,

because, you know, i just dont wanna
follow certain trends

that i see other bands following.

we dont necessarily have
to stick to our traditional way,

but we also dont have
to follow that trend.

im actually very, very comfortable
with my role in the band, you know?

ive actually always been very, very
comfortable with my role in the band.

im not a really egotistical person.

in fact, ive-- i spend a large
amount of my time trying to, like,

downplay my ego
and get it even smaller and smaller.

thats part of my beliefs.

i try to be an example
of being egoless to the other guys.

hi! this is kirk from metallica.

and if you want money,
youll listen to us.

and then some other guys
gonna give you cash.

twenty years worth of integrity,

and, you know,
credibility and all that.

the next five minutes
is gonna change all that.

"hey, man, keep it locked right here,
and--" what?

"well help you score $    ."

this is james from metallica.
survey says, you need cash.

your money-shot to snatch
a bunch of cash is coming soon.

in order to suck both
nationwide radio chains off,

we are now standing here
having to do this fucking stupid thing.

up to    motherfucking grand,
goddamn it!

win a bunch of money.

and walk away.

this is stupid!

sharpen that booger-picking finger

and be the   th--

hey, its lars from metallica. im
about to stick    grand up your ass.

one dollar at a time.

i was telling lars last night
that was hard for me to see

- you guys squirm like you were.
- yeah.

because i wanted to say anything,
and its not my place to say anything.

i cant imagine bono or the edge
going on the radio,

saying what you guys
are being asked to say.

- dad, can i have one of those?
- go for it.

should we catch up
on all this radio stuff?

okay. now, theyre
the biggest chain in america.

you know, its like       stations
or something.

and if you guys think its crappy, as a
radio thing, those guys think its good.

i mean, thats their idea.
we didnt come up with that.

so strategically--

why are we doing it, then?
just to make them happy?

yes.
thats exactly what theyre doing.

and they wont say, "fuck you,
you never do anything for us.

were gonna fuck you
on the next record. "

people would do that?

"because you didnt give us something,
were gonna fuck you?"

yes, james. they would.

im not saying that they
can always get away with it.

thats so funny.

- it wouldnt stop them from trying.
- im glad its your world.

i understand the "wash your back,
you wash mine" thing.

"wash my--" "ill wash your back
so you dont stab mine,"

- right.
- is more like it.

okay. why dont we get off
the phone, then.

well, you know, we should have this
conversation some more next week.

- later.
- okay.

- see you.
- bye-bye.

thats insanity. "were gonna hurt you
because we didnt get something."

i wash your back
so you dont stab mine.

well, thats a good line for a song.

i guess i just want something
to rhyme with "mine" right now.

wash your back so you wont...

wash your back
so you wont stab mine.

step on a landmine.

keep you in my back pocket.

blind leading the blind.

ill rip out your fucking spine.

okay.

all right.

wash your back
so you wont stab mine

get in bed with your own kind

wash your back
so you wont stab mine

get in bed with your own kind

- that was really good.
- are you pulling my mike?

- that was really good.
- it was.

- really good.
- so then, the part--

landmine

landmine

no landmines

no landmines
rock lobster

wash your back
so you wont stab mine

get in bed with your own kind

theres a witch at the foot of my bed.

did you--?
did you hear what lars said?

he says, "yeah, kirk stopped reading,
and i stopped moping."

- thats what you said.
- thats not what i said.

- whatd you say?
- i said, i stopped sulking.

oh, sulking.

shit!

in the    months since hes
parted company with metallica,

ex-bassist jason newsted has been
apparently more musically active

than his former band mates.

while metallica drummer lars ulrich
was pursuing napster,

and singer james hetfield
battled alcoholism,

newsted hooked up in the studio
with legendary metal band voivod.

our own lann robinson got all the
answers on newsteds new ventures

and the current state
of his relationship with metallica.

a good friend hinted

that jason would really like
to join the band again.

man, i popped his little bubble
for a second and-- i dont know, man.

ill be quite honest.

i think the heart and soul of metallica,
from this point on,

and has been for a while, since
cliff died, is the three of you guys.

i think you will never, ever, ever find
a permanent bass player.

my opinion.

there was also tragedy
in rock this week.

metallicas bassist cliff burton
was killed in a bus accident

while the band was on tour
in sweden. he was   .

metallica bassist cliff burton
was buried on tuesday

in the san francisco area.
remaining members of the band...

jason newsted.
he replaced cliff burton,

who was killed in an auto accident
in september.

jason told...

it pisses me off that cliff left us

because wed never have
that initial four guys

just going on and on.

you know, when i talk about it,
its like that happened for a reason.

and were-- were dealing with that.

i gotta capitalize
on whats being said right here.

the cliff message that i get
from him to you guys is,

that treasure the three of you.

treasure every moment
that the three of you have.

and the four of you have.
you know, treasure--

treasure it because you never know.

and one of the sad things
that happens when somebody dies

is that people have never
taken the time along the way

to really embrace each other
every day. you know?

its a sin if you--
you know, if you let that go.

phil has been like an angel for me.

hes been sent to help me.

and, you know, ive got
my own thoughts about all that,

you know, a father figure,
the dad that never was

and all of that, that it makes
me comfort--

it comforts me.

but also, we dont want to have
our hand held through life.

wed like to be able to stand proud
ourselves and move on.

therell be a time for that.

and we just have to discuss
when that is.

you know, there is purpose
behind the way i do it.

i think its very effective.

i have to decide whether
im going to push it or not.

it sometimes is a distraction.

so, what part of our career
are you gonna manage today?

i thought id do the whole thing,
since you guys cant do anything.

if you guys could run something,

then it would be easy to step back.
because you cant, you know...

is today the first day youre
gonna play drums?

- i dont wanna get into that.
- okay.

no. i dont think
im gonna do the drums.

- i think its time--
- maybe i should.

- yeah. i think its time.
- although, actually, im kind of...

well, its about the only thing
you havent done.

- i havent sung.
- right.

we got to a point
where we sat down and told phil

that we wanted to scale phil back
to every other week.

and we were getting ready
to implement that

four weeks from when
the decision was made.

and two weeks
after the decision was made,

we had to sit phil down and say
that we were not ready to do that.

because we got really...

i dont know. scared, i guess.

there were some things
that were going on at the time

that, really, phil helped with a lot.

live from the news leader
in northern california.

newscenter  . night beat.

the metallica v. napster battlefield
moved to san mateo today.

metallica drummer lars ulrich
delivered a list of screen names

of people who have downloaded
the bands music online.

metallica is suing napster,
a website that provides software

which allows people to download
music on the internet without paying.

metallica drummer lars ulrich testified
before a senate committee

earlier this month that napster has
"hijacked our music without asking."

the band said
that over        people

are downloading its music for free.

a group of former metallica fans
staged a protest at the courthouse.

i dont want anything to do
with metallica anymore.

im gonna be trashing their cds.
i took all my cds,

and im gonna be destroying them.

are you proud
of what you achieved with napster?

are you proud in hindsight
of what you pulled off?

being the most hated man
in rock n roll?

yeah, that was-- that was my goal.

i got an idea.
im kind of bored this summer.

everythings going a little too well.

lets see, i wanna turn myself

into the most hated fucking
asshole in rock n roll, yeah.

like, good afternoon, my name is, you
know, like, lars ulrich, from metallica.

i worked for years to get
where i am today.

me and my buddy
james hetfield here

have shed blood, sweat and beer
to get where we are today.

beer, good.

who do you think you are?
i mean, just, you know,

because you, like, made us rich,
you think you can get free stuff?

songs that we spent upwards
of, you know,

like    to    hours writing
and recording.

our team of lawyers and researchers
have your names,

and you napster users, well see you
in jail getting gang-raped.

some minutes
i have all this strength,

and i can stand there and just go,
"fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

im bulletproof, it doesnt matter.

i got hetfield and hammett,
and were a team, and fuck you."

you know what i mean?
five minutes later,

it means nothing, and i just
become really vulnerable.

you know,
we never sat there and thought

about where napster
was gonna end up.

we never sat there and talked about
what shots we were gonna take.

we just sat there and thought about,
this was something we had to do.

so wait a sec.

that was awesome!

its like i had to stay
on the course that i was on

and stay to my convictions,
but it was eating away at me inside.

and then maybe it could go
lyrically to:

"what difference did l/we actually
make?" its a great question. great.

and if that could-- its like if that
question could get thrown out there,

but remain unanswered,
i think thats really strong.

all the shots i take

what difference did i make?

all the shots i take

i spit back at you

"all the shots i spit back at you."

thats awesome, dude.
fucking...

- fuck me.
- and the "what difference did i make"

- fit right in.
- really awesome. right on.

these two kicks,
are they the same as--?

- its different.
- okay.

go to the master. what really gets
my dick hard is starting on:

you know, there.
then these are awesome.

lars, what i wanna know is,

do the four of you just go in there
and just jam?

youre hearing excerpts
of three-hour jams.

youre hearing-- look at it as a funnel.

youre hearing the very part
of the bottom of the funnel.

- right.
- you can almost equate

- what were doing now to arranging.
- youre like pollock, the painter.

he is. hes pollock,
the funnel-arranger guy.

its gonna sound fucking amazing
at the stadium

with        people
fucking raising the evil horns

up to the sky and saying,
"metallica, baby."

oh, can we fast-forward
to that right now?

i think what id like to do is,

id like to talk about
this touring thing that has come up.

were very cognizant of the fact

that things have changed
for you guys.

and theyve changed
for many, many reasons.

why cant we figure out what works
best for everybody

in their personal lives,
plus what works best as a business?

what if you just do a stadium tour,

where you play friday, saturday
and sunday,

and then you go home
the rest of the week?

i just wanna put out that,

you know, it might be a kind
of uncomfortable vibe here

because people might not know
how im feeling about touring,

and i dont really know either.
you know? until i get there.

and, you know, i wanna tour.

i dont wanna fall off the wagon,
you know.

i dont wanna go out there--
i dont know what its like.

doing things for the first time again, as
i think ive said before, its a little scary.

i dont know about you,
but its, like, summertime.

and to me, its fucking
beer-drinking weather, yeah?

yeah. well, im gonna take time
right now and fucking have myself one,

and i just wanna say cheers
to all you guys

and fucking thanks for coming down
and getting nutty with us. cheers.

i blew my voice out
on the "black album,"

doing "so what," the cover song.

and we had a bunch of metallica
songs to do after that.

and i went to this coach. i didnt--

i didnt wanna go. i was scared.

i thought he was gonna make me
sing operatic.

but i went there,
and we just did warm-up stuff like this,

and this is the tape. and ive had
this same tape for-- since then.

- was there a turning point?
- yeah.

i think when we had accumulated
what we thought to be,

you know, a great kind of...

i dont know,
cross section of material,

we took stock, so to speak.

the only songs that
are gonna make it to the album

are the songs that
all four of us vote on.

and out of   -plus songs,
only four songs got all four votes.

sweet amber
sweet amber

sweet amber

how sweet are you?

how sweet does it get?

how sweet are you?

how sweet does it get?

- yeah, right.
- wow.

i mean, theres some explosive playing.
the shit just takes off.

its like you guys have spent
all this time

to come back to find yourselves.

- thats what it sounds like to me.
- all right,    to go.

yeah, how are you doing?
do you wanna hear more?

- wanna hear more?
- im just getting started.

squeeze all within my hands

choke within my hands

im madly in anger with you
im madly in anger with you

im madly in anger with you

time, time, times like this

- boy
- you got what youre coming to

- so
- destruct the power within all

across your spine
so that gets broken too

temptation, fill no hole

no

no, no

temptation

you know, the first four songs
youve played me,

all pretty much knocked me out.

okay? but if youve got it going, you
want it to hammer all the way through.

you want people to be able
to really listen and say:

"jesus christ, theres
no letting up from these guys.

theres no fucking letup."

fuck ballads. you know?

there definitely is some presidio stuff
that i felt, maybe--

you gotta analyse it. maybe youre

watering it down in some way.
thats all.

- its your call.
- yeah.

i know that...

"temptation,"
i remember writing that thing.

it came out.
it flowed, totally, instantly.

"temptation" kind of sums up
all the lyrics

that are in this new kind of project.

so-- and that-- and its cool
because that was done

long before recovery
and all that, so...

i mean, i can tell that youre singing
your heart out.

youre definitely wearing your heart
on your sleeve on that song.

to me, its more like a jam.

is there a song in there?

potentially.

you know, theres almost nothing
there that cant be turned

into something better than it is
or something

that could probably
get pretty fucking close

to being something
on a metallica record.

you know, but then it just goes away
from what the purpose--

at least, what i see the purpose
being today,

which is show up with what you--

you know, what are your a-pluses?
you know?

well, when i hear lars talk
about "we can whip anything

into decent shape," i agree.

and we did that on
load and reload.

and this is us trying to choose

before we take it to those extremes,
you know?

- exactly.
- that makes sense.

that was a pretty major thing that i
think lars and i clicked on together,

that, wow, id heard him,
and he heard me.

oh, its like, "oh, okay."

its like it takes the cutting edge
off of it

or the personal attack off of it,
you know?

things are a lot less dramatic
than they used to be

within the chemistry
of the four of us.

less head games, abuse of power
and soap-opera bullshit.

but can we just do one thing?

for lack of a better word,
when it comes in with the drums,

i just want you to scream,
"fuck,"

as hard as you can fucking scream.

fuck

okay. it should be slower.

it should be more like:

i want four of them. do it again.

lars is selling paintings

because hes ready to move on
to the next ten years

or next decade
or next phase of his life.

and a lot of what these paintings and
a lot of what this house represents

is the last ten years versus
a husband and father of two.

hes getting rid of some pretty
major and important pieces

in the majority of his collection.

hes wiping the slate clean.

midnight, new york city.

one last look at the paintings.
oh, well.

- its a celebration.
- this is a celebration.

- of how far youve come.
- its a celebration.

with phil towle.
this is a celebration.

some paintings have visited us
for a while.

and now we wanna share them
with other people.

- okay?
- right, yeah. thats it.

- its a choice.
- okay, cool.

i never looked at it as an investment,
but i always looked it as--

versus some of the other guys
that may be, like, taking

a big pile of money and parking
it in the bank,

i would always, like, take a big pile
of money and park it on my wall.

i can just feel some of the adulation
that other people have thrown

at these paintings,
and that makes me proud.

ive never been this close to it.

these are great paintings, whether
they sell for a dollar or for $    million.

the only thing that matters
is what pleasure

and what feeling you get out of that
moment you have with that painting.

and its never been
about dollars and cents.

its always been about something
greater than that.

but, fuck, they do look awesome.
i mean, fuck.

its been a good time.

- and it will be a good time.
- to the future.

i feel better about this
than i thought i would, actually.

- its weird, i dont know why.
- yeah.

shit.

$      .

$
on the telephone.

its two of you in the room,
selling right, fair warning at $      .

jean paul, $      .

twenty-one is the moderna
on the reverse,

the jean-michel basquiat showing
on the screen there on my right.

- all right, here we go.
- be strong, my friend.

$      . at $ .  million.

.    million.

$       .
$      .

- can we get more cocktails?
- $      --

-    .
-    .  . .

-    .
- $  million.

- come on,  .
- for you, sir, $      .

$      .

and selling at $  million.
brett, yours at   million.

- all right.
- hi.

it went well.

i got myself drunk to numb the pain.

but it went well. im happy.

like, lets talk about the zone
for a minute.

because there is a way to help
a person-- persons get in a zone.

to-- i mean, you could consider
seriously doing some meditative,

or apply the meditative principles
to music, all right?

i dont want this to sound
too way-out,

but if you do that,
the four of you are out there,

and you do it anyway, unconsciously,
you do a musical meditation

by starting to jam with each other.

i just think,
no matter how you look at it,

ive been making records a very
long time, and it really comes down

to how much work you put in
and how much...

you know, its just tough. sometimes
its just-- its just tough work.

and i like to stretch the frontiers
of what people accept, okay?

and i understand about that.
and l--

i dont want, for my mind, to settle...

i guess im not gonna
be playing today, then, huh?

well, im gonna go out
and make phone calls.

so everybodys...

you know, weve had
a fabulous few weeks

with a lot of great productivity,
a lot of really good stuff going on.

the more we feel good
about ourselves and each other

and the higher we ascend,
the more challenging

it will be to our psyches.

you know, i understand it.
i embrace it and all that stuff,

but sometimes it just bugs me.

i think the-- that thing was
kind of bugging me yesterday.

all of them around the studio,
it was just kind of, like--

that way of thinking, it just
doesnt work for me all the time.

and i was a little pissed off at it,

because right now in my life
its not really working for me.

- im glad to know thats how you feel.
- i agree with that wholeheartedly.

and if you feel that way
and wish to share that more directly,

- id appreciate that too.
- rather than tearing the signs down?

- yeah.
- we pay him $      a month

to be pretty much available
at our beck and call.

so when this records done,

do we want to collectively end
the $     -a-month, full-on thing?

im afraid hes under the impression
that hes, like, in the band, you know?

yeah.

and i see him coming on the road,
maybe, for a week.

but after that i dont-- i dont see him

holding our hand
any further than that.

so is that something we wanna
present to him, then?

- yeah. i think that--
- okay.

i think its something--
yeah, i think its something

we need to do
for our own well-being.

yeah, because
im feeling uncomfortable.

yeah, hello? hello, hello.

are they on the phone?

theyre on the phone,
and they need you.

oh, okay.

- james hetfield is in the room.
- hey there.

- hey, james, how you doing?
- pretty good.

ill let marc do the talking. hes
the one whos been talking to mtv.

okay, this afternoon,
the official offer came in for icon.

- assuming you wanna do it.
- lets do it.

cool, man.
yeah, im jazzed about it.

the only thing that you guys
are required to do

is show up for rehearsal
and then show up

for the show on the  rd,
and at the end of the show

you guys take the stage
and perform a little bit.

- so, whats jasons role in all this?
- what? who?

cliff? i mean,
i dont think jason has any role.

he lost his icon status
when he left metallica.

- nice one, cliff.
- thank you.

i think mtv would like the fact
that this would most likely be

the introductory performance
of metallica with a new bass player,

whether its the new member
or whoever.

when is it supposed to be?
may what?

may  rd. saturday, may  rd.

see, that means youd have
to hire someone by the  nd.

- okay.
- i think it can happen.

youd be required to be in
los angeles for all of two days...

because we didnt get a new
bass player, i think a lot of people

thought maybe that we were
having trouble finding one.

we never started looking for a new
bass player until two months ago.

we worked on ourselves,
identified what part can we work on

so when someone else steps in,
its clean.

theyre not stepping in our shit,
you know?

all right, thinking about
bass players, finally?

so were gonna need
a fourth member.

you know, we know youre
a great bass player. its the vibe.

we need to make sure...

jason kind of triggered this whole thing
a couple of years ago.

and i cant believe its been two years.
and now weve gone through some...

we realized that we kind of wanted
somebody who was, like, our age.

somebody who had been
around the block a couple times.

weve grown a lot, man.
these three guys

and this band.

and last time, when we did this
years ago,

years ago, i guess it was,

we literally sat down and started
auditioning bass players,

you know, the day after
the funeral for cliff.

so now its    years later,
different circumstances.

when jason left,
he took his basses with him.

do you want a four or five?

whatever.
what five-strings do you have?

this ones a five-string.

keep searching

keep on searching

this search goes on

this search goes on

the band-- these guys
collectively probably own,

like, five to     guitars,
so theyre not all here.

on and on

tick tick tick tick tick tick tock
frantic

tick tick tick tick tick tick tock
frantic

tick tick tick tick tick tick tock
frantic

tick tick tick tick tick tick tock

you went into
another voice there, dude.

which one of me are you talking to?

think that we should just spend the
next two and a half hours with this guy.

dont you?

i had a vision of us jamming
with him the last hour.

i guess i just feel this is just
kind of, like, weird to keep,

like, just doing our own thing.
it just feels not welcoming.

this morning i heard him say
he was pretty comfortable.

its not about what he says.
its about what i feel.

- all right?
- are we cool, james?

yeah. i guess the only other thing
id like to say is,

you know, when we leave this up
to just how were feeling,

a lot of it depends
on how youre feeling.

you know,
when you say those things.

not that i wanna break up
what you guys are discussing,

if you wanna go deeper, you know?

but i think what might be really good
is to treat this with respect,

go out and do this...

metallica stuff?

- i could try "battery."
- "battery"?

you can play that fast
with your fingers?

battery

thats a fucking pretty mighty
bass sound you got going there.

- yeah, its fucking--
- i dont know.

its the mesa and the hiwatt.

is there anything else you know
as well as that?

cliff. it was just like you saw cliff,

and me and james went,
"hes in our band, theres no question."

he hit it out of the park.

and thats where it
sort of gets interesting.

because if cliff burton
showed up today,

maybe he wouldnt be the guy either.

i mean, the three guys that i like
all have unique features

that i would love to frankenstein,
you know?

- yeah! definitely.
- some kind of monster?

that would be great.

i dont think you should settle.
i think you should get the right guy.

if you dont hit it out of the park
with one of these guys,

then youre gonna end up
four years down the road

in the same situation you did
with jason.

a four count, then...
and into the solo.

just follow.

he was the first guy of any of them

- that didnt look like he was struggling.
- thats what i told bob.

do you know what i mean
about, like, it--?

you know, with some
of the other guys,

it was sort of    percent
over their capabilities,

or something like that. you dont
feel that with this guy at all.

its like the last three songs,

like "sanitarium," "nothing else
matters" and what was...?

- "sad but true."
- "sad but true," they were flawless.

i looked over at him
during "whiplash,"

and he was just right in the pocket
and in there.

and then afterwards, when he
played it alone with his finger,

it hadnt been played that way
since cliff.

its just, like:

- yeah.
- yeah, his fingers a pick, you know?

- yeah.
- yeah, its three picks.

all right, are we
gonna sack bob now?

well, the second time
you came back,

i mean, that was, for me,
when i noticed

that you make us play better, man.

you make the band sound
so much better.

- so solid.
- how do you feel about that, man?

well, i feel awesome, man.

- youre the chosen one.
- you looked coolest.

and we want you to be a real member
of this band, not just a hired hand.

and wed like to offer you--
basically, to give--

to show you how serious
we are about this,

offer you a million dollars
to join our band right now.

- and--
- wait, okay.

and as a kind of a good-faith thing
about how serious we are--

its an advance.
its an advance on some percentage

youre gonna be making
with the band.

heres money up front to get you
kicked in and inspired and:

"this is a reality. this is my future.
this is what life can hold for me

with my new family."

i cant really talk right now.

invisible kid
never see what he did

got stuck where he hid
falling through the grid

invisible kid

where hell never be known
inward hes grown

invisible kid
never see what he did

got stuck where he hid
falling through the grid

invisible kid
got a place of his own

where hell never be known
inward hes grown

theres things that i miss,
and im sad it couldnt work out,

and things, you know, like that. but
theres way, way, way, way more times

and way more days and even hours
that go by and im reminded, "dude,

all right.
you did the right thing."

you know, "you did the right thing
for yourself."

i dont know if its the right time
to say this,

but, i dont know,
ive been thinking about our talk.

about, you know, you and us and
our future and all of that stuff, and...

and, you know, when i heard
that you guys were moving here

and all of that, that brought up
a lot of fear around:

"wow, what is phils perception of,
you know, his, you know, longevity

with metallica?" you know?
that scared me a little bit.

well, i appreciate that. i was--

if it scared you, and thats part
of the issue going forward,

then let me say we havent decided
were moving here.

ive tried to make it clear
that were selling--

i think weve told people were selling
our house in kansas city,

but that doesnt mean
were moving here, okay?

and we wont likely move
to san francisco

if theres not a future out there
with metallica,

because, you know, thats my--

i wanna make sure
that the bass players intact.

i wanna be sure that the tours on.

and i also, as i said,
have performance-coach visions

for each of you and for the band.
and l-- to me, the work isnt over.

id like us to honour what we had,

and if you wanna be away from--

you know, on your own or something
for the couple of months

until we come back in june,
thats okay. i just kind of--

i dont know. i guess i have a problem

with the, "lets see how it works out.
lets see how it happens,"

and then, "no, lets honour what
happened, you know, six months ago."

you know? thats kind of strange
to me, you know?

because i think that you use
those things

when theyre convenient at times,
you know?

personal stuff or business things.
and i dont know. i dont know.

theyre-- the boundaries are--
i dont-- becoming more clear to me.

theres that element of-- of trust that
just kind of floats with you with me.

and l-- and that-- im really sorry
about that. that-- you know.

ive been swimming uphill on that one
for a long time with you,

and id like for us
to be able to resolve it.

but maybe we cant.

ive gotta tell you that l--
you know, if the client,

either james or us, says:

you know, then i really think that
needs to be respected without,

you know, just, you know,
the old turn-the-knife thing in there.

you know, its just, you know,
if the client says,

you know, timeout for a while,
timeout.

that is great, although we--
our process, what we normally do--

then it should be put on the table,
but left on the table,

and should be able to walk away
without what youre saying right now,

which is now there are trust issues
and stuff.

i dont know how to separate out--

in its simplest form,
i think its a conflict of interest

that you tell him that he needs
you around more.

- if he has--
- no, no, no, no, no.

im not saying that.

i see that as a conflict of interest.

look, i am saying you guys
have made a decision.

its okay for me to say
im not happy with that decision.

the premise is,
you guys dont need me.

and im good with that.

anyway, you go... its--

- anyway, lets jam.
- great, ill see you guys.

im taking off. ill see you
next week. have a good one.

thanks, man.

whos in charge of my head today?

dancing devils in angels way

its my time now
its my time now

its my time now
its my time

look out, motherfuckers
here i come

im gonna make my head my home

the sons of bitches
try to take my head

tried to make me
someone else instead

youve been in the band for five
minutes, and youre an icon?

its such an honour,
and, you know, im stoked. so...

your voting interest will equal
your percentage interest

in a new account,
while each of our voting interests

will be one-third of the difference

between     percent
and your percentage.

this is about as lawyer as you get.
but its really--

- sort of laying out--
- yeah, lays out the deal.

okay, so, for instance, in the first
period you have   percent, okay?

so when we do a vote, you
get    votes, you get    votes,

you get    votes, you get five votes,
in any vote, okay?

- but this doesnt mean anything.
- i think its crap. i mean, l--

i think in the spirit
of what were trying to do,

we better do    and then
q primes the tiebreaker. thats--

that works, thats fine. cool.

now, here it also says, "you will not
be required to fund any losses

in the new metallica account,
but we will be entitled

to recover any losses out
of future profits."

for instance, buying the documentary,
its not your problem.

if the documentary loses money
and the company never makes

any more money again,
its these three guys problem.

exactly.

"whatd you do with your money?"

"i went and bought a car,
i bought my mom a house,

and we went and bought
a documentary."

it was just-- you gotta keep
in the spirit of this whole thing.

by the end of this week,
were gonna have an album title.

because in three days, we wont
have to agonize about this anymore.

well, the thing that stood out to me
was st. anger. its strong.

i mean, theres--
iconic strong, you know?

- i like that title quite a bit.
- its so easy

just to say,
"june   th is st. angers day."

- yeah, well, its true. thats cool.
- no, i mean--

i think frantic is a better album title.

- i think thats--
- i dont know.

- its more about the record.
- but st. angers a good--

its an original statement.
st. anger, st. anger.

well, this is an angry record,

but you read the lyrics,
its angry in a healthy way.

- its also frantic.
- getting stuff out.

frantic is more like,
"theyre trying things that they dont--

they dont--
theyre not exactly sure of.

they dont know what theyre doing.

theyre trying to climb back up
the mountain again.

theyre not sure of themselves."

i mean, hello, thats a fair thing.

i mean, if you think that frantic
has a negative connotation to it,

i never thought of it like that.

if its st. anger,
theyre gonna form an image of:

"these guys are angry. i know it.

theyre angry about napster.
theyre angry about the new stuff

thats coming in.
theyre angry about their lives.

im angry too. i get it."

i think you guys know the idea about
shooting a video in san quentin.

so let me get this straight.

youre gonna go to
a maximum-security prison,

and metallicas gonna play
"st. anger" really loud.

- yeah!
- yeah!

st. anger round my neck

st. anger round my neck

he never gets respect

st. anger round my neck

ive been asked to come out here
and talk a little bit

about what this song means to us.

angers an emotion that ive struggled
with for pretty much all my life.

- st. anger round my neck
- you flush it out, you flush it out

he never gets respect

theres a lot of misspent anger

that has come out sideways
for a lot of people.

including yourselves.

and if i hadnt had music in my life,

its quite possible i could be in here,
or not even in here, be dead.

and id much rather be alive.

madly in anger with you

im madly in anger with you

im madly in anger with you

im madly in anger with you

im pretty nervous up here.
i dont really know what to say.

im just trying to share
some of whats going on for me.

im not here to sell nothing,
thats for damn sure.

everyone is born good.

everyones got the same size soul,
and were here to connect with that.

so were very proud to be
in your house

and play some music for you.
thanks.

more than any other record,
i dont know if you feel that,

but for me, this is like product

of what were just doing, hanging out.
you know what i mean?

- its almost like a diary.
- yeah.

its like, heres our memories on cd,
you know?

its like weve proven that
you can make aggressive music

- without negative energy.
- yeah.

okay, and i dont think anybody ever
thought that that would be possible.

you know? you can make
something thats aggressive

and fucked up, okay?
with positive energy

- between the people creating it.
- yeah.

it hit me, you know? this projects
coming to an end, and i dont know,

i think im kind of bummed
about that.

im kind of, just, kind of liking
the schedule that happens,

or the safeness in that.
coming here, being able to talk.

creating, you know?
and... i dont know.

ive been kind of coming down
from this for about the past month.

i mean, getting up at   in the morning,
and just pacing my apartment.

just not really knowing
what the hell im doing either.

so im with you.

like, i dont wanna let you go home.

i dont know.

i really appreciate that.
thats really nice of you to say.

i dont know, i can feel myself
kind of protecting myself

with some depression or something,
wanting to just kind of isolate.

and i dont wanna do that.

i wanna feel the sadness of--

i mean, i didnt feel depressed,
i felt sad.

and thats when i knew it was
something different than just me...

my old stuff, you know?

i mean, there is some of that, but...

sadness and depression, i guess
i dont really know the difference.

and, phil, all the stuff
that youve brought here to, like...

youve set out all the tools,
like, you know?

and you allowed us to build
what weve built, you know?

with guidance.

i really appreciate your bringing
this forward.

and there is a difference between
sadness and depression.

clearly.

this is the hugest chapter in my life.

if i could have my wasted days back

would i use them to get
back on track?

stand back. stand back.
keep away from the car.

- i love you.
- i love you too.

can i find it inside
to deal with what i shouldnt know?

could i have my wasted days back
would i use them to get back on track?

you live it or lie it
you live it or lie it

you live it or lie it
you live it or lie it

my lifestyle determines my deathstyle

determines my deathstyle

keep searching
keep on searching

this search goes on
on and on

keep searching, keep on searching

this search goes on

obey your master (master)
master master
master of puppets im pulling your strings
twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
blinded by me, you cant see a thing
just call my name, `cause ill hear you scream
master master
just call my name, `cause ill hear you scream
master master master master master…..
welcome to where time stands still
no one leaves and no one will
moon is full, never seems to change
just labeled mentally deranged
dream the same thing every night
i see our freedom in my sight
no locked doors, no windows barred
no things to make my brain seem scarred
sleep my friend and you will see
that dream is my reality
they keep me locked up in this cage
cant they see its why my brain says rage
sanitarium, leave me be
sanitarium, just leave me alone
build my fear of whats out there
and cannot breathe the open air
whisper things into my brain
assuring me that im insane
they think our heads are in their hands
but violent use brings violent plans
keep him tied, it makes him well
hes getting better, cant you tell?
no more can they keep us in
listen, damn it, we will win
they see it right, they see it well
but they think this saves us from our hell
sanitarium, leave me be
sanitarium, just leave me alone
sanitarium, just leave me the fuck alone
fear of living on
natives getting restless now
mutiny in the air
got some death to do
mirror stares back hard
kill, its such a friendly word
seems the only way
for reaching out again
reach motherfucker reach
hell is worth all that, natural habitat
just a rhyme without a reason
never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
now your life is out of season
i will occupy
i will help you die
i will run through you
now ill rule you, too
come crawling faster (faster)
obey your master (master)
your life burns faster (faster)
obey your master
master master
master of puppets im pulling your strings
twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
blinded by me, you cant see a thing
just call my name, `cause ill hear you scream
master
master
just call my name, `cause ill hear you scream
master
master born to push you around
you better just stay down
you pull away
he hits the flesh
you hit the ground
mouth so full of lies
tend to black your eyes
just keep them closed
keep praying
just keep waiting
waiting for the one
the day that never comes
when you stand up and feel the warmth
but the son shine never comes
no, the son shine never comes
push you cross that line
just stay down this time
hide in yourself
crawl in yourself
you’ll have your time
god i’ll make them pay
take it back one day
i’ll end this day
i’ll splatter color on this gray
waiting for the one
the day that never comes
when you stand up and feel the warmth
but the son shine never comes
love… is a four letter word
and never spoken here
love… is a four letter word
in this prison
love… is a four letter word
and never spoken here
love… is a four letter word
here in this prison
and i will wait no longer
i’ll put an end to this, i swear
this, i swear. the son will shine
this, i swear
this, i swear
this son will shine! make his fight on the hill in the early day
constant chill deep inside
shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
on they fight, for the right, yes, but whos to say?
for a hill, men would kill, why? they do not know
stiffened wounds test their pride
men on fire, still alive through the raging glow
gone insane from the pain that they surely know
for whom the bell tolls
time marches on
for whom the bell tolls
take a look to the sky just before you die
it is the last time you will
blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
he hears the silence so loud
crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see
for whom the bell tolls
time marches on
for whom the bell tolls how could he know this new dawn’s light
would change his life forever?
set sail to sea, but pulled off course
by the light of golden treasure
was he the one causing pain
with his careless dreaming?
been afraid, always afraid
of the things he’s feeling
he could just be gone
he would just sail on
he’ll just sail on
how can i be lost, when i’ve got nowhere to go?
shovel streets of gold
how come it’s got so cold?
and how can i be lost, when my ship was made to drift?
and how can i blame you
when it’s me i can’t forgive?
these days drift on inside this fog
its thick and suffocating
his sinking life, outside its hell
inside, intoxicating
ships run aground. like his life
the waters much too shallow
he goes down, down with his ship
sinking in the shadows
now a castaway
they’ve all gone away
all gone away
how can i be lost, when i’ve got nowhere to go?
shovel streets of gold
how come it’s got so cold?
and how can i be lost, when my ship was made to drift?
and how can i blame you
when it’s me i can’t forgive?
forgive me
forgive me not
why can’t i forgive me?
set sail to sea, but pulled off course
by the light of golden treasure
how could he know this new dawn’s light
would change his life forever?
how can i be lost, when i’ve got nowhere to go?
shovel streets of gold
how come it’s got so cold?
and how can i be lost, when my ship was made to drift?
and how can i blame you
when it’s me i can’t forgive? like a siren in my head and there is no emergency
like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding drivers seat
like a face that learned to speak, when all it knew was how to bite
like a hurt that keeps me focused though ive think gone astray
like a load of rain that i must awaken from each day
like a dream
a beautiful dream
not worthy of so i deny ...... yeah
you close your eyes and try to wish it all into place
you never opened them so it passed you by
you close your eyes so you may never fall from grace
you open just in time to say goodbye
almost like your life
almost like your endless fight
struggling along
balancing in right and wrong
why is it so hard
always pull the joker card
almost like your fight
and there it went
almost like your life
like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
like a spring that cannot be in current till its time to drink
like a puzzle, with missing pieces, and the box is thrown away
like a release from prison that i didnt know i was in
like a fight to live the past i prayed to leave from way back then
like a general without a mission until the war will start again
you close your eyes and try to wish it all into place
you never opened them so it passed you by
you close your eyes so you may never fall from grace
you open just in time to say goodbye
almost like your life
almost like your endless fight
struggling along
balancing in right and wrong
why is it so hard
always pull the joker card
almost like your fight
and there it went
almost like your life. .... yeah.... ohh yeah
ohhhhhhhhhh yeaahh
like a touch from hell to feel how hot that it can get if you get caught
like a touch from heaven on this breeze that brings you straight down to your knees
like a touch from hell to feel how hot that it can get if you get caught
like a touch from heaven on this breeze that brings you straight down to your knees
ohhhh yeaahhh
almost like your life
almost like your endless fight
struggling along
balancing in right and wrong
why is it so hard
always pull the joker card
almost like your fight
and there it went
almost like your life
that was just your life metallica

the lines that crack you face
famine
your body it has torn through
withered in every place
pestilence
for what you have had to endure
and what you have put others through
death
deliverance for you for sure
there is nothing you can do
sound is ripping through your ears
the deafening waiting for his whips
your bodies waiting for his whips
the taste of leather on you lips
hear the cry of war
louder than before
with this sword in hand
to control the land
crushing metal strikes
on this frightening night
fall onto your knees
for the phantom lord
victims falling under chains
your hear them crying death pains
the fists of terrors breaking through
now theres nothing you can do
hear the cry of war
louder than before
with this sword in hand
to control the land
crushing metal strikes
on this frightening night
fall onto your knees
for the phantom lord
soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death
the gods are laughing, so take your last breath

suitcase in my hand
jacks in his corset, says to jane, whos in her vest
me, babe, im in a rock n roll band
friday nights a picture show
those were different times
and the poets studied rules of verse
and all the ladies rolled their eyes
sweet jane
sweet jane
sweet jane
now, jack, he is a banker
and jane, she is a clerk
and the both of them are saving up their money
then they come home from work
sittin by the fire
radio just played a little classical music for you kids
the march of the wooden soldiers
and you can hear jack say
sweet jane
sweet jane
sweet jane
some people like to go out dancing
and other people, they gotta work
and theres always some evil mothers
theyll tell you life is full of dirtand the women never really faint
and the villans always blink their eyes
and the children are the only ones who blush
cause life is just to die
but, anyone who has a heart
wouldnt want to turn around and break it
and anyone who ever played the part
he wouldnt want to turn around and fake it
sweet jane  sleep, and dream of this
death angels kiss
brings final bliss
come believe me
empty they say
death, wont you let me stay
empty they say
death, hear me call your name
oh, call your name
suicide, ive already died
youre just the funeral ive been waiting for
cyanide, living dead inside
break this empty shell forevermore
wait, wait patiently
your death-black wings
unfolding sleep
spreading oer me
empty they say
death, wont you let me stay
empty they say
death, hear me call your name
oh, call your name

suicide, ive already died
its just the funeral ive been waiting for
cyanide, living dead inside
break this empty shell forevermore
say, is that rain or are they tears
that stained your concrete face for years?
the crying, weeping, shedding strife
year after year, life after life
an air of freshly broken ground
a concrete angel laid right down
upon the grave which swallows fast
its peace at last
o peace at last
empty they say
death, wont you let me stay
empty they say
death, hear me call your name
oh, call your name
suicide, ive already died
youre just the funeral ive been waiting for
cyanide, living dead inside
break this empty shell forevermore

forevermore
forevermore
its the funeral ive been waiting for opposition - contradiction
premonition - compromise
agitation - violation
masturbation... on our face
darkest color: blistered earth... true death of life
never hunger - never prosper
i have fallen prey to failure...
struggle within triggered again
now the candle burns at both ends...
halls of justice painted green, money talking
power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
soon youll please their appetite, they devour
hammer of justice crushes you, overpower
the ultimate in vanity
exploiting their supremacy
i cant believe the things you say
i cant believe, i cant believe the price you pay
nothing can save you

justice is lost - justice is raped - justice is gone
pulling your strings... justice is done
seeking no truth - winning is all
find it so grim, so true, so real
apathy, their stepping stone, so unfeeling
hidden, deep animosity, so deceiving
thru your eyes, their light burns, hoping to find
inquisition sinking you with prying minds
the ultimate in vanity
exploiting their supremacy
i cant believe the things you say
i cant believe, i cant believe the price you pay
nothing can save you
justice is lost - justice is raped - justice is gone
pulling your strings... justice is done
seeking no truth - winning is all
find it so grim, so true, so real
blackened is the end - winter it will send
throwing all you see into obscurity
death of mother earth - never a rebirth
evolutions end - never will it mend... never

fire, to begin whipping dance of the dead
blackened is the end
to begin whipping dance of the dead
color our world blackened
fire is the outcome of hypocrisy
darkest potency
in the exit of humanity
color our world blackened! blackened! (judas priest cover)
pounding the world like a battering ram
forging the furnace for the final grand slam
chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
leaving a trail of destruction thats second to none
hammering anvils straining muscle and might
shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
fast devastating and desolisating the curse
blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth wielding the axe comes the one culmination
thats always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed
sifting the good from the bad its the age for the rage
of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
now grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled
till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
the slipping and sliding corrosive subsiding that withered and wained till the world seemed all drained fills the bay
pounding the world like a battering ram
forging the furnace for the final grand slam
chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
leaving a trail of destruction thats second to none
second to none say your prayers, little one
dont forget, my son
to include everyone
i tuck you in, warm within

told me when i was young
"son, your lifes an open book
don’t close it fore its done"
"the brightest flame burns quickest"
is what i heard they say
a son’s hearts owned to mother
but i must find my way
let my heart go
let your son grow
mama, let my heart go
or, let this heart be still
"rebel," my new last name
wild blood in my veins
apron strings around my neck
the mark that still remains
left home at an early age
of what i heard was wrong
i never asked forgiveness
but what is said is done
let my heart go
let your son grow
mama, let my heart go
or, let this heart be still
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
so let this heart be still
mama, now im coming home
im not all you wished of me
but a mothers love for her son
unspoken, help me be
i took your love for granted
and all the things you said to me, yeah-yeah
i need your arms to welcome me
but a cold stones all i see
let my heart go
let your son grow
mama, let my heart go
or, let this heart be still
let my heart go
mama, let my heart go
you never let my heart go
so, let this heart be still
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
so, let this heart be still life, it seems, will fade away
drifting further every day
getting lost within myself
nothing matters, no one else
i have lost the will to live
simply nothing more to give
there is nothing more for me
need the end to set me free
things not what they used to be
missing one inside of me
deathly loss, this cant be real
cannot stand this hell i feel
emptiness is filling me
to the point of agony
growing darkness taking dawn
i was me, but now hes gone
no one but me can save myself, but its too late
now i cant think... think why i should even try
yesterday seems as though it never existed
death greets me warm, now i will just say goodbye
goodbye...

to running all of his

throughout his life the same
hes battled constantly
this fight he cannot win

to die regretfully
that old man here is me

constant chill deep inside
shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
on they fight, for theyre right, yes, but whos to say?
for a hill, men would kill, why? they do not know
stiffened wounds test their pride
men of five still alive through the raging glow
gone insane from the pain that they surely know
for whom the bell tolls
time marches on
for whom the bell tolls
take a look to the sky just before you die
its the last time you will

shattered goal fill his soul with a ruthless cry

crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be

lashing out the action, returning the reaction
weak are ripped and torn away
hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
battery is here to stay
smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
cannot stop the battery
pounding out aggression, turn into obsession
cannot kill the battery
cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
battery
battery

crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
never-ending potency
hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
breeding on insanity
smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
cannot stop the battery
pounding out aggression, turn into obsession
cannot kill the battery
cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
battery
ooo - battery
heeeeyy!
circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
powerhouse of energy
whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
we create the battery
smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
cannot stop the battery
pounding out aggression, turn into obsession
cannot kill the battery
cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
battery
battery
battery
battery
