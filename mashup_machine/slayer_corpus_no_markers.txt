aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah

auschwitz, the meaning of pain
the way that i want you to die
slow death, immense decay
showers that cleanse you of your life
forced in like cattle
you run
stripped of
your lifes worth
human mice, for the angel of death
four hundred thousand more to die

angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead

sadistic, surgeon of demise
sadist of the noblest blood
destroying, without mercy
to benefit the aryan race
surgery, with no anesthesia
feel the knife pierce you intensely
inferior, no use to mankind
strapped down, screaming out to die

angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead
infamous butcher
angel of death

pumped with fluid, inside your brain
pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
burning flesh drips away
test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
frigid cold cracks your limbs
how long can you last
in this frozen water burial?
sewn together, joining heads
just a matter of time
till you rip yourselves apart
millions laid out in their
crowded tombs
sickening ways to achieve
the holocaust

seas of blood, bury life
smell your death as it burns
deep inside of you
abacinate, eyes that bleed
praying for the end of
your wide awake nightmare
wings of pain, reach out for you
his face of death staring down
your bloods running cold
injecting cells, dying eyes
feeding on the screams of
the mutants hes creating
pathetic harmless victims
left to die
rancid angel of death
flying free


angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead
infamous butcher
angel of death
angel of death trapped in purgatory
a lifeless object, alive
awaiting reprisal
death will be their acquittance
the sky is turning red
return to power draws near
fall into me, the skys crimson tears
abolish the rules made of stone

pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above

awaiting the hour of reprisal
your time slips away

raining blood
from a lacerated sky
bleeding its horror
creating my structure
now, i shall reign in blood how ive waited for you to come
ive been here all alone
now that youve arrived
please stay awhile
and i promise i wont keep you long
ill keep you forever (forever, forever, forever)

graze the skin with my fingertips
the brush of dead, cold flesh appease the means
provoking images, delicate features so smooth
a pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon

dance with the dead in my dreams
listen to their hallowed screams
the dead have taken my soul
temptations lost all control

simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
lose all mind control, rationale declines
empty eyes enslave the creations
of placid faces and lifeless pageants

in the depths of a mind insane
fantasy and reality are the same


graze the skin with my fingertips
the brush of dead, warm flesh pacifies the means
incised members ornaments on my being
adulating the skin before me

simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
lose all mind control, rationale declines
empty eyes enslave the creations
of placid faces and lifeless pageants

dance with the dead in my dreams (hello? hello, mr. gein?)
listen to their hallowed screams (mr. gein?)
the dead have taken my soul (let me out of here, mr. gein)
temptations lost all control (mr. gein? i dont want to play anymore, mr. gein)
dance with the dead in my dreams (mr. gein, this isnt fun anymore)
listen to their hallowed screams (i dont wanna play anymore, mr. gein)
the dead have taken my soul (mr. gein? i want out of here, mr. gein)
temptations lost all control (let me out now) an unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
unsuspecting victims, no warnings, no signs
judgment day, the second coming arrives
before you see the light, you must die

forgotten children conform a new faith
avidity and lust controlled by hate
the never ending search for your shattered sanity
souls of damnation in their own reality

chaos rampant
an age of distrust
confrontations
impulsive habitat

bastard sons begat your cunting daughters
promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers
ingrate souls condemned for all eternity
obtained by immoral observance a domineering deity

chaos rampant
an age of distrust
confrontations
impulsive sabbath

on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven


the root of all evil is the heart of a black soul
a force that has lived all eternity
the never ending search for a truth never told
the loss of all hope and your dignity

chaos rampant
an age of distrust
confrontations
impulsive habitat

on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven aaaaaaahhhhh


blasting our way through the boundaries of hell
no one can stop us tonight
we take on the world with hatred inside
mayhem, the reason we fight
surviving the slaughters and killing weve lost
then we return from the dead
attacking once more now with twice as much strength
we conquer, then move on ahead

evil
my words defy
evil
has no disguise
evil
will take your soul
evil
my wrath unfolds


satan, our master in evil mayhem
guides us with every first step
our axes are growing with power and fury
soon therell be nothing else left
midnight has come and the leathers strapped on
evil is at our command
we clash with gods angels and conquer new souls
consuming all that we can

evil
aah, haha
evil
has no disguise
evil
will take your soul
evil
my wrath unfolds razors edge
outlines the dead
incisions in my head
anticipation the stimulation
to kill the exhilaration

close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane

innate seed
to watch you bleed
a demanding physical need
desecrated, eviscerated
times perpetuated

close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane


inert flesh
a bloody tomb
a decorated splatter brightens the room
an execution, a sadist ritual
mad intervals of mind residuals

close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane arrogance, violence, world in disarray
dealing with insanity every fuckin’ day
i hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fuckin’ scene
pissing match of egos, fuck your vanity
ain’t got the time, i don’t want anything from you
feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin’ do
no looking back, no regrets, no apologies
what you get is what you see

live fast, on high
repentless, let it ride

my songs relive the atrocities of war
can’t take society any fuckin’ more
intensity, anarchy, hatred amplified
playing this shit is all that keeps me alive
i leave it all on the road living on the stage
this is my life where i kill it everyday
so take you shot, bottom’s up, this is no lie
i’ll be beating this guitar ’til the day i die

live fast, on high
repentless, let it ride

i hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fuckin’ scene
pissing match of egos, fuck your vanity
ain’t got the time, i don’t want anything from you
feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin’ do
no looking back, no regrets, no apologies
what you get is what you see
we’re killing ourselves a little more everyday

live fast, on high
repentless, let it ride drones since the dawn of time
compelled to live your sheltered lives
not once has anyone ever seen
such a rise of pure hypocrisy
ill instigate, ill free your mind
ill show you what ive known all this time

god hates us all, god hates us all
you know its true, god hates this place
you know its true, he hates this race

homicide, suicide
hate heals, you should try it sometime
strive for peace with acts of war
the beauty of death we all adore
i have no faith distracting me
i know why your prayers will never be answered

god hates us all, god hates us all
god hates us all, god hates us all
yeah, he fuckin hates me

pessimist, terrorist targeting the next mark
global chaos feeding on hysteria
cutthroat, slit your wrist, shoot you in the back, fair game
drug abuse, self-abuse, searching for the next high
sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time
im waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies

i never said i wanted to be gods disciple
ill never be the one to blindly follow

man-made virus infecting the world
self-destruct, human time bomb
what if there is no god? would you think the fucking same?
wasting your life in a leap of blind faith
wake the fuck up, cant ignore what i say
i got my own philosophy
i hate everyone equally
you cant tear that out of me
no segregation, separation
just me in my world of enemies

i never said i wanted to be gods disciple
ill never be the one to blindly follow
ill never be the one to bear the cross
disciple

i reject this fuckin race
i despise this fuckin place

i despise this fuckin place join us: backwards 66 x
welcome back


existing on damnations edge
the priest had never known
to witness such a violent show
of power overthrown
angels fighting aimlessly
still dying by the sword
our legions killing all in sight
to get the one called lord

the gates of hell lie waiting, as you see
theres no price to pay, just follow me
i can take your lost soul from the grave
jesus knows your soul can not be saved

crucify your so-called "lord"
he soon shall fall to me
your souls are damned, your god has fell
to slave for me eternally
hell awaits

the reaper guards the darkened gates
that satan calls his home
demons feed the furnace where
the dead are free to roam
lonely children of the night
theres seven ways to go
each leading to the burning hole
that lucifer controls

priests of hades seek the sacred star
satan sees the answer lies not far
zombies, screaming souls, cry out to you
satanic law prevails, your life is through

pray to the moon, when it is round
death with you shall then abound
for what you seek for cant be found
in sea or sky or underground


now i have you deep inside
my everlasting grasp
the seven bloody gates of hell
is where youll live your last
warriors from hells domain
will bring you to your death
the flames of hades burning strong
your soul shall never rest

the gates of hell lie waiting, as you see
theres no price to pay, just follow me
i can take your lost soul from the grave
jesus knows your soul can not be saved

sacrifice the lives of all
i know they soon shall die
their souls are damned to rot in hell
and keep the fires growing deep inside
hell awaits propaganda death ensemble, burial to be
corpses rotting through the night, in blood-laced misery
scorched earth, the policy, the reason for the siege
the pendulum, it shaves the blade, the strafing air blood raid

infiltration push reserves, encircle the front lines
supreme art of strategy, playing on the minds
bombard till submission, take all to their graves
indication of triumph: the numbers that are dead

sport the war
war support
the sport is war, total war
when victorys really massacre
the final swing is not a drill
its how many people i can kill


sport the war
war support
the sport is war, total war
when victorys really survival
the final swing is not a drill
its how many people i can kill

be dead, be from above
when darkness falls
descend onto my sights
your fallen walls
spearhead break through the lines
flanked all around
soldiers of attrition
forward their ground

regime prophetic age
old in its time
flowing veins run on through
deep in the rhine
center of the web
all battles scored
what is our war crimes
era forever more
war


propaganda war ensemble, burial to be
bones, shining by the night, in blood-laced misery
campaign of elimination, twisted psychology
when victory is to survive, and death is defeat

sport the war
war support
the sport is war, total war
when the end is a slaughter
the final swing is not a drill
its how many people i can kill you go to the church, you kiss the cross
you will be saved at any cost
you have your own reality, christianity
you spend your life just kissing ass
a trait thats grown as time has passed
you think the world will end today
you praise the lord, thats all you say

jesus saves
listen to you pray
you think youll see the pearly gates when death takes you away

for all respect, you cannot lust
in an invisible man you place your trust
indirect dependency
eternal attempt at amnesty
he will decide who lives and dies
depopulate, satanic rise
you will be an accessory
irreverence and blasphemy


jesus saves
no need to pray, the gates of pearl have turned to gold
it seems youve lost your way


jesus saves
no words of praise, no promised land to take you to
there is no other way funeral held for the depression of man
holds the key to his own death
entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
tighten the tourniquet around your neck
sifting away the debris of hated life
cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
seeking life beyond your perishment
repeating words echoing through your mind

chanting lines of blind witchery
to save yourself from extinction
wanting to die is your reason to live
new life born from the oppressed
taste your blood as it trickles through the air
another casualty, beyond the shadows you fall
losing ground, the fate you feel draws near
fatality, reality, await the final call


my sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity
vessels in my brain carrying death until my birth
come and die with me forever, share insanity
do you wanna die?!

the waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies
turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind
non-rising body from the grave showing new reality
what i am, what i want, i’m only after death disease spreading death, entire population dies
dead before youre born, massive suicide
vicious game of fear, its all extermination now
poison in your veins, global genocide
slaughter governs law, the apocalypse begins
pain becomes the norm, seeking homicide
beware the coming storm that starts illuminating fires
god is laughing hard, man has gone insane

world painted blood, no sanctuary
world painted blood, no sanctuary

tip the human scale, follow revelations plan
it must come to pass, secret shadows lie
blueprint haunting dreams, in which manipulation wins
speak no hidden fears, religion neutralized
emerged from the dark, sadist mercenary ride
realm not of this world, godless messengers
sickless, mindless hate becomes evolutions cure
planets usher in, alignment god has died

world paintved blood, no anctuary
world paintsdeblood, no sanctuary!

god send death
watch it bleed
justified
manufactured lives born in hell
angels fall
wings on fire
crucified
terrorizing man, burn the world
reflecting eyes
sickle swings
wave of blood
suicidal mind from the start
endless pain
open wounds
slit the throat
radiation child seeks the throne

strafing down
demigods
certain death
coming from the stars, lord of all
dark rift rise
flourish life
perish man
we destroy ourselves, cease to live
childrens blood
feed the dead of sea of flesh
catastrophic fall
rest in hell
flaming corpse
screaming eyes
watch it die
walk among the dead, pick your grave



like a disease spreading death, erasing your existence
like a disease spreading death, erasing your existence

satans hand begins the end
and frees the world forever
gomorrahs dream to live in sin
has reached its critical mass
man himself has become god
and laughs at his destruction
in which we trust a secret government
is now in total collapse




signs of disease, rivers red, blood in ice, plague

welcoming our death! i have witnessed your death
ive seen it many times
your tortured screams
your decrepit little mind
a fathers son
with pathetic eyes that bleed
twins in the end
begin and let the brothers fall

i will see you burned alive
screaming for your god
i will hunt you down again for him

god wont judge what ive done
he crawls upon my feet
a privileged pain
beneath buried are your dead
on splintered bones i walk
sifting through the blood
besieged to fear
await the coming of the god

i will watch you die again for him

blood is raining downward
the stain reflects the sun
conquer divide within
terrorize the mind
ive seen the end its yours
rosary in hand
your selfish flesh it melts
spilling from the sky

i will see you burned alive
screaming for your god
i will watch you die

this is gods war
gods war
this is gods war
gods war

war of holy principles
im seeking gods help in your destruction
slit the throat of heathen man
and let his blood dilute the water
bury your dead

fuck your god erase his name
a lady weeps insane with sorrow
ill take his towers from the world
youre fucking raped upon your deathbed

this is gods war
gods war
this is gods war
gods war
fucking holy war


be optimistic, happy, and calm
show no fear or anxiety
smile at the face of god
and your reward will be eternity
holy warriors, your patience will be justified
everything is for him
you must not comfort the animal before you kill it
strike as champions at the heart of the nonbelievers
strike above the neck and at all extremities
for its a point of no return for almighty god
god will give victory to his faithful servants
when you reach ground zero you will have killed the enemy
the great satan eternal, the kiss i breathe
siphon your blood to me
feel my wounds of your god
forever rape mortality
i smell of death, i reek of hate, i will live forever
lost child, pay the dead
bleeding screams of silence
in my veins, your eternity

ill kill you and your dreams tonight
begin new life
bleed your death upon me
let your bloodline feed my youth

first breath born, come alive, learn to kill
bloodfest awaits to feed your hunger
dark side has no rival test, your faith in blood
night hides the hunting packs, a feeding frenzy

ill kill you and your dreams tonight
begin new life
bleed your death upon me
let your bloodline feed my youth

i am the first, not the last
condemned by a single kiss
betrayed eternally
ill rip inside your soul
contaminating the world
defying god and son
black heart that brings your death
living in infamy


drink the flesh of life itself
prepare to reign a thousand years

ill kill you and your dreams tonight
begin new life
bleed your death upon me
let your bloodline feed my youth

bleed your death upon me
bleed your death upon me
bleed your death upon me
let your bloodline feed my youth
blame gods chosen children
as you die, im immortal
faithless, no religion
stalking prey is my confession
captive blood, enslavement
pain and hunger drives your madness
drink flesh, life itself
prepare to reign a thousand years murder at your every footstep
a childs toy, sudden death
sniper blazes you through your knees
falling down, can you feel the heat?
burn

ambushed by the spray of lead
count the bullet holes in your head
offspring sent out to cry
living mandatory suicide

suicide
suicide
suicide
suicide


holes burn deep in your chest
raked by machine gun fire
screaming soul sent out to die
living mandatory suicide

suicide
suicide
suicide
suicide

lying, dying, screaming in pain
begging, pleading, bullets drop like rain
mines explode, pain sheers through your brain
radical amputation, this is insane
fly swatter stakes drive through your chest
spikes impale you as youre forced off the crest
soldier of misfortune
hunting with bated breath
a vile smell, like tasting death
dead bodies, dying and wounded
litter the city streets
shattered glass, bits of clothing and human deceit
dying in terror
bloods cheap, its everywhere
mandatory suicide, massacre on the front line
aaaaaaahhhh waiting the hour destined to die
here on the table of hell
a figure in white, unknown by man
approaching the altar of death
high priest awaiting, dagger in hand
spilling the pure virgin blood
satans slaughter, ceremonial death
answer his every command

death will come easy, just close your eyes
dream of the friends, youll see
heavenly failure, losing again
move on to a new form of life

altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned
confronting the evil you dread
coalesce into one your shadow and soul
soon you will meet the undead


altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned
confronting the evil you dread
coalesce into one your shadow and soul
soon you will meet the undead

enter to the realm of satan!


blood turning black, the change has begun
feeling the hatred of all damned in hell
flesh starts to burn, twist and deform
eyes dripping blood, realization of death
transforming of five toes to two
learn the sacred words of praise, hail satan


a gift of powers disposed upon you
use them when you feel the need
master the forces and powers of satan
controlling the creatures instinct
drawn to the castles that float in the sky
learn to resist the temptation
watching the angels sift through the heavens
endlessly searching for salvation modulistic terror
a vast sadistic feast
the only way to exit
is going piece by piece

you have no choice of life or death
my face you will not see
ill rip your flesh till theres no breath
dismembered destiny

as soon as life has left your corpse
ill make you part of me
no emotion
death is all i see

modulistic terror
a vast sadistic feast
the only way to exit
is going piece by piece

bones and blood lie on the ground
rotten limbs lie dead
decapitated bodies found
on my wall, your head

on your trail, i close the gap
one more life that soon wont be
no emotion
flesh is all i need

ill send you to your maker
confront the god you seek
a flash of red upon your chest
safety out of reach

you have no choice of life or death
my face you will not see
ill rip your flesh till theres no breath
dismembered destiny

modulistic terror
a vast sadistic feast
theres only one way out of here
piece by piece cursed, black, magic night
weve been struck down
down in this hell
spells surround me day and night
stricken by the force of evil light
the force of evil light

cast under his spell
blinding my eyes
twisting my mind
fight to resist the evil inside
captive of a force of satans might
a force of satans might

fighting the curse
break it, i must
laughing in sorrow
crying in lust


my strength slips fast, soon i must fall
victim of fortune, my sources grow small
life slips away as demons come forth
death takes my hand and captures my soul night will come and i will follow
for my victims, no tomorrow
make it fast, your time of sorrow
on his trail, ill make you follow

quarters for the criminally insane
the sentence read for life i must remain
the path i chose has led me to my grave
to try again, id have no other way

quarters for the criminally insane
escape, for me, has fast become a game
soon to be, ill leave without a trace
endangered species, end the human race


branded in pain, marked criminally insane
locked away and kept restrained
disapprobation, but what have i done
i have yet only just begun to take your fucking lives

night will come and i will follow
for my victims, no tomorrow
make it fast, your time of sorrow
on his trail, ill make you follow nightmare, the persecution
a childs dream of death
torment, ill forgotten
a soul that will never rest
guidance, it means nothing
in a world of brutal time
electric, circus, wild
deep in the infants mind

silent scream
bury the unwanted child
beaten and torn
sacrifice the unborn

shattered, another child
bearer of no name
restrained, insane games
suffer, the children condemned
scattered, remnants of life
murder, a time to die
pain, sufferaged, toyed
lifes little fragments destroyed

silent scream
crucify the bastard son
beaten and torn
sanctify lives of scorn


life preordained
humanity maintained
extraction, termination
pains agonizing stain
embryonic death
embedded in your brain
suffocation, strangulation
death is fucking you insane

nightmare, the persecution
a childs dream of death
torment, ill forgotten
a soul that will never rest

innocence withdrawn in fear
fires burning, can you hear cries in the night? you need to take a closer look at me
cause i was born to be the thorn in your side
no matter what you think youre gonna see
you never wanted this barrage of fucking pride
you dont want none of me

pissing your common sense away
when you draw first blood you cant stop this fight
for my own peace of mind, im going to

tear your fucking eyes out
rip your fucking flesh off
beat you till youre just a fucking lifeless carcass
fuck you and your progress
watch me fucking regress
you were made to take the fall, now youre nothing
paybacks a bitch, motherfucker

your life must suck when nothings going your way
everything melts away before your eyes
youre just a punk that doesnt have the sense to get away

pissing your common sense away
when you draw first blood you cant stop this fight
for my own peace of mind, im going to

tear your fucking eyes out

to come shining down on me
i dont want you to die
before i get the chance to kill you myself

pissing your common sense away

of a life i want

a world i haunt
youve lost all control of my
heart and soul
satan holds my future
watch it unfold

i am the antichrist
its what i was meant to be
your god left me behind
and set my soul to be free

watching disciples
of the satanic rule
pentagram of blood
holds the jackals truth
searching for the answer
christ hasnt come
awaiting the final moment
the birth of satans son


screams
from a life i live
torment
is what i give
torture
is what i love
the downfall
of heavens above

i am the antichrist
all love is lost
insanity is what i am
eternally my soul will rot
rot, rot strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain
limb dissection, amputation from a mind deranged
asphyxiation, suffocation, gasping for air
explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair?
ripping apart, severing flesh
gouging eyes, tearing limb from limb
experimentation, slow infection, internal decay
execution, need transfusion, body rots away
sliced incision, zero vision, loss of vital signs
skin contortion, bone erosion, your life becomes your fine
ripping apart, severing flesh
gouging eyes, tearing limb from limb


strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain
limb dissection, amputation from a mind deranged
asphyxiation, suffocation, gasping for air
explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair
sliced incision, zero vision, loss of vital signs
skin contortion, bone erosion, your life becomes your fine

necrophobic, cant control the paranoia
scared to die driving compulsion morbid thoughts come to mind
sexual release buried deep inside
complete control of a prized possession
to touch and fondle with no objection
lonely souls an emptiness fullfilled
physical pleasure and addictive thrill
an object of perverted reality
an obsession beyond your wildest dreams
death loves final embrace
your cool tenderness
memories keep love alive
memories will never die
the excitement of dissection is sweet
my skin crawls with orgasmic speed
a lifeless object for my subjection
an obsession beyond your imagination
primitive instinct a passion for flesh
primal feeding on the multitudes of death
sadistic acts a love so true
absorbingly masticating a part of you
death loves final embrace
your cool tenderness
memories keep love alive
memories will never die
i need a friend
please be my companion
i dont want to be
left alone with my sanity

erotic sensations tingle my spine
a dead body lying next to mine
smooth blue black lips
i start salivating as we kiss
mine forever this sweet death
i cannot forget your soft breaths
panting excitedly with my hands around your neck
shades are drawn
no one can see
what ive done
whats become of me
here i stand
above all thats been true
how i love
how i love to kill you frantic minds are terrified
life lies in a grave
silent death rides high above
on the wings of revelation
multi-death from chemicals
arrogance has won
annihilation must be swift
destroy without destruction

gods of the throne must be watching from hell
awaiting the mass genocide
soldiers defeated by death from a smell
bodies lie dormant no life
rising new souls on the land where they fell
demons not ready to die
nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie
chemical warfare

artificial fucking peace
line up in death row
generals in their slow defeat
diminish from this hell
banished from the dying world
the lords of hell await
dogs of war are helpless prey
to immortality

gods of the throne must be watching from hell
awaiting the mass genocide
soldiers defeated by death from a smell
bodies lie dormant no life
rising new souls on the land where they fell
demons not ready to die
nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie
chemical warfare

fuck it up!


liquidate
the torture kills the troops that try to fight
terminate
human pesticide bring days of doom
mist falls
the deadly gas that brings them to their knees
sacrifice
steal the soul and send his corpse to hell


mummified regions lying in dust
fall victim to this game
petrified corpses bathing in rust
taken without being blamed
falsified spirits, farther they fall
soon they will join us in hell
see the sky burning, the gates are ablaze
satan waits eager to merge

gods of the throne must be watching from hell
awaiting the mass genocide
soldiers defeated by death from a smell
bodies lie dormant no life
rising new souls on the land where they fell
demons not ready to die
nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie
chemical warfare

warfare! minutes seem like days
since fire ruled the sky
the rich became the beggars
and fools became the wise
memories linger in my brain
burning from the acid rain
a pain i never have won

nothing here remains
no future and no past
no one could foresee
the end that came so fast
hear the prophet make his guess
that paradise lies to the west
so join his quest for the sun

shades of death are all i see
fragments of what used to be


the world slowly decays
destruction fills my eyes
harboring the image
of a spiraling demise
burning winds release their fury
simulating judge and jury
drifting flurries of pain

deafening silence reigns
as twilight fills the sky
eventual supremacy
daylight waits to die
darkness always calls my name
a pawn in this recurring game
humanity going insane

shades of death are all i see
skeletons of society

shades of death are all i see
fragments of what used to be
fragments of what used to be
skeletons of society


minutes seem like days
corrosion fills the sky
morbid dreams of anarchy
brought judgment in disguise
memories linger in my brain
life with nothing more to gain
perpetual madness remains

skeletons of society

shades of death are all i see
fragments of what used to be
fragments of what used to be
skeletons of society oppression is the holy law

pride in prejudice
dont give me that power bullshit
pride in prejudice
one gunshot sets the precedence

abuse of power, civil unrest
money in blood is of no significance
inner rage waiting to ignite
blood of the innocent unites

im right youre wrong
in number, im strong
violence is proof enough that i am

pride in prejudice

marshall law as militant state

fire burns with media hype
speak the truth through your own lies

one gunshot sets the precedence
pride in prejudice
dont give me your bullshit
pride in prejudice
one gunshot killed the innocent

some love to hate
right in your face
violence will facilitate
fuel the fire with racial slurs
and see who kills the other first gun down cold on a raw deal
home turf, my battlefield
in no ones way, caught in a crossfire
stray bullet can kill

expendable youth
fighting for possession
having control of principle obsession
rivalry and retribution
death, the only solution

injured soul on the hard ground
head blown off, face down
lying in a pool of blood
an accidental death homicide

expendable youth
fighting for possession
having control of principle obsession
rivalry and retribution
death, the only solution
fighting you motherfuckers


struggling to survive
this drug induced warfare
having control of principle obsession
expendable youth, fighting for possession
violence is only a friend

expendable youth
fighting for possession
having control of principle obsession
rivalry and retribution
death, the only solution breeding fast in poverty
infectious, driving, dormant seed
inside your carcass start to mate
left in charge to dominate

waiting to unfold
raging uncontrolled
adapt a potency
death machine, infest my corpse to be

unyielding kings of agony
test your body chemistry
pulmonary overthrow
possession of your inner throne
infections quickly override
malicious, domineering strike
floods your veins, commit slow death
deteriorate your makers met

perpetual demise
on a fast decline
killing tendency
epidemic, permanent disease


incapacitate, fall into your fate
pain results in screams
bleed internally
years will pass before it can be cured time melts away in this living inferno
trapped by a cause that i once understood
feeling a sickness building inside of me
who will i really have to answer to

march on through the rivers of red
souls drift, they fill the air
forced to fight, behind
the crooked cross

do only what is expected of me
with no emotions, my feelings suppressed
blind obedience carries me through it all
conscience, a word i learned to forget

march on through the rivers of red
souls drift, they fill the air
forced to fight, behind
the crooked cross


time melts away in this living inferno
trapped by a cause that i once understood
blind obedience carries me through it all
do only what is expected of me

march on through the rivers of red
souls drift, they fill the air
forced to fight, behind
the crooked cross convicted witch, my life will end
at midnight on the stake
my dedicated life was spent
to insubordinate
secured, by lock, inside a cell
imprisoned for no crime
these shackles will be useless
when your life is out of time

incantation spell gone by
ill see life again
my deals were made eternally
i signed the book of red
my rage will be unleashed again
burning the next morn
death means nothing, theres no end
i will be reborn

no gift of exile in my fate
ill get no amnesty
i cant control my destiny
there is no habitual need
proclaim my death, to end my wrath
it takes more than one try
indulge your ineffective curse
i will never die

you think by killing me tonight
my powers will not rise
therell be nowhere for you to run
when hatred comes to life
condemned to fill the prophecy
allowing no first born
defy your morbid declaration
leave you ripped and torn


count your blessing, would-be priest
as i burn upon the stake
youd be forgiven endlessly
but your values are all fake
forever servant of my lord
by choice and not submission
maybe now ive made you wonder
am i superstitious?

incantation spell gone by
i will live again
my deals were made eternally
i signed the book in red
my rage will be unleashed again
and burning the next morn
death means nothing, theres no end
i will be reborn i dont want to see
i dont want to hear
i dont want to feel anything
cant you understand
everything i do doesnt stem from you
it doesnt have a fucking thing to do with you
i just want to die
throw it all away
never have to feel again, the way you make me
lose my fuckin mind all the fuckin time
cant control the violence that spews from me
take it

i cant control the rage that flows from me
i cant shut it down, it overwhelms me
i cant stop the rage that flows from me

cant stop the violence, i love it
no ones immune to hate that flows from it
infectious, i feed on it
every fucking endless day
youre either on my side or else youre in my way
no one stands a chance when im lashing out
random hate, there is no other way
its my discipline, its my way of life

never wanted bliss

never needed anyone, ive polluted
everything you feel
everything you are
everything youll ever be
and you repulse me
its always about you

i cant stop the rage
i cant stop to hate you
i cant control the violence awakened, i have become
light now slips away
manipulate your mind
darkness is my slave
taste the sins of hell
the blood that i so crave
the last thing that you see
is the hunger in my eyes

blood sucking creatures of the night
nocturnal spectre hiding from the light
cries screaming out every fright
eagerly awaiting plight
apparitions from the pits of hell
death plagues the streets in which they dwell
demented lust, the secrets they must keep
addicted to your blood
at dawn they sleep

unveil the hidden coffin
lift the lid of terror
feel the deadly cold
freeze you from inside
perceiving your intentions
to slay the phantom form
raise the stake in malice
you cannot plunge it down

blood sucking creatures of the night
nocturnal spectre hiding from the light
cries screaming out every fright
eagerly awaiting plight
apparitions from the pits of hell
death plagues the streets in which they dwell
demented lust, the secrets they must keep
addicted to your blood
at dawn they sleep


beware the image unseen
stalks your soul
your corpses redeem
eternal damnation, your just reward
a servant of our lord
by your accord
admonish of the cruciform
impalement
immortalitys scorned
rise, hold fast your faith
to lie dormant
is certain death

driven by the instinct of centuries of horror
implanted along the brain of the sickening parasite
linked together by one trait
the hell-ful need to kill
kill, kill, kill, kill

emerging from their hellish tomb
taking flight amidst the night
the evening skies are raining death
swooping down from shadowed skies
taking simple human form
shed their wings to stalk the mortal man
lock their jaws into your veins
satanic soldiers strike their prey
leaving corpses waiting for the change
blood dripping from the jaws of death
not enough to satisfy
they must drain your soul of life live by the sword and help to contain
the helpless minds of you all
die by my hand in pools of blood
clutch yourself as you fall
mindless tyranny, forgotten victims
children slaughtered in vain
raping the maids, in which they serve
only the words of the lord

die by the sword
die by the sword

satan watches all of us
smiles as some do his bidding
try to escape the grasp of my hand
and your life will no longer exist
hear our cry, save us from
the hell in which we live
we turn our heads toward the sky
and listen for the steel

die by the sword
die by the sword


watch as flowers decay
on the cryptic life that died
the wisdom of the wizards
is only a nurtured lie
black knights of hells domain
walk upon the dead
satanas sips upon
the blood on which he feeds
hahahahaha


die by the sword
die by the sword blood was like paste on the walls
bodies lay lifeless like dolls
a moment that felt like days
lives extinguished in a rage
so nauseous i dont realize
incessantly feeding the flies
in the moment of visceral haze
the last thing you see are my crazed eyes
the last thing you see are my eyes
fear lies beneath your facade
in panic you scream for your god
no way ill ever abstain
blood falls from the ceiling like rain
patiently unleash my violence
ingesting the sweet sound of your silence
in darkness this feeling i love
to be covered in blood... blood from above
this violence finally sets me free
brings demons back to torture me
theres no god pulling at my strings
im above all sorrow faith can bring
disengaged i see your face
an adrenaline rush i cant replace
hands around your neck
your senses numb
staring into your eyes when the stillness comes on your back, look on to me
youll see genocide
face from death, more than insane
profane, pleading cries
watch you die inside, watch you die

god send death and misery
preach no love of ministry
pray for sin, a shattered faith
down on your knees
youre screaming out to die

death is overdue
nothing can save you
a morbid symphony
hearing you lie there screaming (out to die)
taking life from you
is all i wanna do
desire so deranged
this is what lives inside me

putrid blood flows through my veins
to thrive on demise
voyeurs lust, watching the pain
touching you inside
bleed you fucking dry
bleed on me

deaths design, blood-splattered wall
face melting, one vicious whore
twisted figures, flesh from bone
down on your knees
youre screaming out to die

death is overdue
nothing can save you
a morbid symphony
hearing you lie there screaming (out to die)
taking life from you
is all i wanna do
desire so deranged
this is what lives inside me

clawing at the eyes of god
you taste your death in hand
your fingers bleed in vain
you scream in your grave
clawing at the eyes of god
you pierce your throat and hands
youve gone insane with pain
youre blind, screaming for your god (pathetic god)


deaths design, blood-splattered wall
face melting, one vicious whore
twisted figures drown your mind in pain

god send death and misery
preach no love of ministry
pray for sin, a shattered faith
down on your knees
youre screaming out to die

clawing at the eyes of god  welcome to my world
involve yourself within my dream
experience a life
just like your mind thought not to be
take a look through time
as past or present worlds to be
i rule this inferno
enthroned for eternity

coils of the serpent unwind
buried beneath you will find
deep in the halls of the damned
spirit in black till the end

spirits damned to rot
amidst the brimstone firewalls
eyes of the dead
watching from their living halls
broken glass reflections
show your flesh eaten away
beyond the gates, ill take you
where the blood forever rains

coils of the serpent unwind
buried beneath you will find
deep in the halls of the damned
spirit in black till the end


coils of the serpent unwind
buried beneath you will find
deep in the halls of the damned
spirit in black till the end

afterlife confessions
tell me who you used to be
looking on in wonder
as i show you it was me
burning from within
you know one spark is all it takes
hear the piercing cries of all
who found that hell awaits

living nightmare, cant you see
you really have no choice
faded memories haunt you
listen closely to my voice
feed me all your hatred
empty all your thoughts to me
i can fill your emptiness
with immortality


welcome to my world
involve yourself within my dream
experience a life
just like your mind thought not to be
take a look through time
as past or present worlds to be
i rule this inferno
enthroned for eternity peaceful confrontation meet war machine
seizing all civil liberties
honest ballotation among banshee
spilling blood on humanity

you cannot hide the face of death
oppression ruled by bloodshed
no disguise can deface evil
the massacre of innocent people

deviated lies, fear blinds your eyes
enforcing their truth through a gun
aggressive discipline and barbaric control
thousands of people cannot be wrong

you cannot hide the face of death
oppression ruled by bloodshed
no disguise can deface evil
stains the primitive sickle
blood red


growing opposition with words as ammunition
expressions of lifes liberties
aggressive discipline and barbaric control
spilling blood throughout humanity

you cannot hide the face of death
oppression ruled by bloodshed
no disguise can deface evil
stains the primitive sickle
blood red through the night we rise in pairs
lords of night, we ride
from the depths of hells domain
reborn to reign this night
roam throughout the endless wars
hold high his name, we must
warriors from the gates of hell
in lord satan we trust

stalking the night, cant you feel i am near
watching each step that you take
i take lives and show all no mercy this night
attack those not knowing their fate

brothers of the prince of night
by bargains we have made
allies with the darkened souls
our legions, we must save
fight for our eternal quest
god cant save you in time
evil stalks the night with us
your soul, it shall be mine

stalking the night, cant you feel i am near
watching each step that you take
i take lives and show all no mercy this night
attack those not knowing my force


i am the menace in your eyes
the one you cant escape
your life falls in my grasp
you know your end is near
you pray your god will help
his strength, no match for mine
your last hope slips away
thy soul begins to bleed
i tear your flesh to shreds
burn holes throughout your mind
your eyes now filled with blood
a victim of my force
in endless agony
you realize your defeat
recite my masters chants
your soul now his to keep

stalking the night, cant you feel i am near
watching each step that you take
i take lives and show all no mercy this night
attack those not knowing their fate i had you back, but its no use
false accusations are on the loose
you know what? it makes no sense that you tied your own noose
you never felt the sores decay
your perfect world is ending today
so what? i wouldnt have it any other way


is this your paradise? you think you thought this through?
cause when you rolled the dice, the house came down on you
dont care what you do or say, your suicide begins today
have fun in paradise, this hell is just for you

you against you
shitty time to make a stand all without a master plan, just you
you against you

so hows your paradise? hindsight just laughs at you
with conflict comes a price, that price weighs heaviest on you
i guess i should say thanks, dissension in the ranks
you panic lit the fuel; now its you against you

shitty time to make a stand all without a master plan, just you
you against you


the seeds are what youve sown

you against you
wasnt looking for a fight, but im showing up tonight
shitty time to make a stand all without a master plan, just you
you against you mortuaries, dead of night
my body starts to rise
in my mind, the horror lives
to feel death deep inside
relentless lust of rotting flesh
to thrash the tomb she lies
heathen whore of satans wrath
i spit at your demise

virgin child, now drained of life
your soul cannot be free
not given the chance to rot in hell

satans cross points to hell
the earth, i must uncover
a passion grows to feast upon
the frozen blood inside her
i feel the urge, the growing need
to fuck the sinful corpse
my task complete, the bitchs soul
lies raped in demonic lust


her stomach bursts, the casket breaks
the seed has taken form
a writhing shape of twisted flesh
the devils child is thrown
hungry for the smell of death
he rules forbidden evil
vengeance with a frenzied hatred
the bastard now must die

lost souls of the dead
form legions that burst through hells gates
death of one sacrifice
to avenge the raped corpse from the grave
blood of one mortal man
the fire grows stronger within
fate of a frenzied lust
lucifer takes my dark soul

down to the fiery pits of hell
down to the fiery pits of
hell im sorry
for something i didnt do
lynched somebody
but i didnt know who
you blame me
for slavery
a hundred years before i was born
guilty of being white 

guilty of being white 
im convicted
of a racist crime
ive only served
19 years of my time

guilty of being white 
guilty of being right grand canyons of space and time universal
my mind is subjected to all

stab, fight
the hooks to my brain are well in
stab, fight
i know what i am, im berlin

cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
i face the impregnable wall

stab, fight
the hooks to my brain are well in
stab, fight
i know what i am, im berlin


exploding, reloading, this quest never ending
until i give out my last breath

stab, fight
the hooks to my brain are well in

in a web like hell
how did i reach this place
why are they haunting me
i cannot look at gods face
paralysing
brilliant light
trying to run
want to scream, but cannot speak
i cannot look at gods face
blind my eyes, i cannot see
what is being done to me
in my mind is only pain
all the memories are drained
victimized
specimen
deathless torture
void with no mercy
black shroud blinds those who see
violated
naked before you i stand
shattered shrine of flesh and bone
gods piercing through my soul
segments of my life
morbid pieces of reality
twisted personality
many faces yet faceless
familiar things give way to strange
no mercy no reason just pain
fatal
sub-conscious control
threshhold of pain unfolds
transfixed martyr saving race
who am i to judge thy grace
awaken
in a web like hell
how did i reach this place
why are they haunting me
i cannot look at gods face
blind my eyes, i cannot see
what is being done to me
in my mind is only pain
all the memories are drained cascaded darkness, walls close in on me
nailed shut, but my eyes still see
severe anguish as my body evolves
the pain of life after death, it resolves


emptiness in twilights rebirth
the faint sounds of shoveled earth
madness growing as your mind dissolves
merely secret in my dreams


night grows cold, twilights near
on the edge of madness, the wounds are sheared
forms of hanging, flesh shredded carcass
no spared breath
imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode
dead soul
stone cold
out into the night

voices inside my head
hold me under
voices oppress
like roaring thunder
an echo bouncing inside my brain
how much can i take of the pain
the pain

a war raging deep inside my head
a split decision that will end with me dead
you see the agony in my eyes
protruding aimless
i think its time to
die


a cannibals desire feeds the fire
that burns in your head


intense pain eats away at your brain
thorazine pumping through your veins


death walks inside you
smell death around you
hells evil spell takes a soul
hear the sound of the bell
counting off death tolls


laughing as you eternally rot
searching for human flesh
and lifes blood


live undead
dead holy man, open up your eyes
to the ways of the world youve been so blind
as the walls of religion come crashing down
hows the ignorance taste the second time around?

tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end
tell me what its like when the celebration begins

welcome to the horror of the revelation
tell me what you think of your savior now
i reject all the biblical views of the truth
dismiss it as the folklore of the times
i wont be force fed prophecies
from a book of untruths for the weakest mind
join the new faith for the celebration
cult of new faith fuels the devastation

holy man, come and worship me
i am all that you ever wanted to be
im the life of indulgence you never knew
the epitome of evil shining through

tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end
tell me what its like when the celebration begins

welcome to the horror of the revelation
tell me what you think of your savior now
i reject all the biblical views of the truth
dismiss it as the folklore of the times
i wont be force fed prophecies
from a book of untruths for the weakest mind
i keep the bible in a pool of blood
so that none of its lies can affect me

this is new faith
a different way of life
witness the shame
see for yourself the lies
ill take the fight
bring it every time, any time
refuse to let them win
my heresy begins

pray for life, wish for death
pray for life, know, in time, youll pray for death

tear it away
it lives inside your mind
silence the fear
that keeps you pure inside
now you can see
lifes atrocities endlessly
witness the miracle
witness the miracle

pray for life, wish for death
pray for life, with every breath
youll pray for death, youll pray for death
embrace new faith, embrace new faith

yeah, new faith
yeah, new faith a misty night, a perfect night
beneath the cold of the frozen star
you feel the fright, you know im near
you never should have come this far
im alive, you cant kill me
i will survive eternity

go through the fire, walk past the dead
lost in my eternal maze
your heart pounds through the mist-filled air
your concentration breaks for me to strike
youve cowered down, youve broken the chain
now i can freeze your burning eyes


you see me lift the axe, as it plunges through your shield
you now begin to panic, as you see your chances grow slim
youre running through the endless maze
you turn and ill be there
a force too strong for you to fight
ill see your end tonight

you think you can destroy me? youd better think again
i am eternal terror, my quest will never end
ill trap you in the pentagram
and seal your battered tomb
your life is just another game
for satans night of doom this fucking countrys lost its grip
sub-conscious hold begins to slip
the scales of justice begin to tip
the legal system has no spine
its corroding from inside
slap your hand and youll do no time
reality on vacation
all across a blinded nation
mentally under sedation
anyone can be set free
on a technicality
explain the law again to me
here in 1994
things are different than before
violence is what we adore
invitation to the game
guns and blades and media fame
every day more of the same
murder, mayhem, anarchy
now are all done legally
mastermind your killing spree
unafraid of punishment
with a passive government
theres nothing for you to regret
nothing to regret
unimposing policy
no enforcing ministry
gaping with judicial flaws
watch a fading nation crawl
clashing with the publics frame
im the one thats place in fame
legislature sets the stage
social slaves caught in my rage
administrative anarchy theres nothing
you can do to me
the world around you is drifting to a
continental tomb you see
violence is my passion
i will never be contained
living with aggression and its
everlasting reign fate, silent warriors, sleeping souls will rise
once forgotten soldiers come to life
fallen mercenary, dormancy is done
not content with wars weve never won

memories cant ignore
anguish of before
satisfy the scorn
rise, ghosts of war

target, assassinate, time of your life has expired
hatred, victimize, gaze in their eyes as they die
violence, inflicting of pain, savage morticians deny
drive the salt in the wound, arouse the subconscious to lie

memories cant ignore
anguish of before
satisfy the scorn
rise, ghosts of war


i deal in pain
all life, i drain
i dominate
i seal your fate
i deal in pain
all life, i drain
memories cant ignore
rise, ghost of war i stab you right between the eyes
you awaken from the lies
i said it ever since the inception
where the masters of deception
im a godless heretic
not a god-fearing lunatic
thats why its become my obsession
to treat god like an infection
my scars insane, my life profane
i deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!
like a storm that devastates
religious doubt i instigate
take a listen to my confession
there is no filter on my aggression
with a blister open wide
to keep the massacre alive
i got cold devastation
with my moral imperfection
my scars insane, my life profane
i deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!
religious death, i instigate
from what the bible demonstrates
does it document creation
of this hopeless infliction
of a godless heretic
not a god-fearing lunatic
thats why its become my obsession
to treat god like an infection
my scars insane, my life profane
i deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!
open life scars, crushing open wounds
the walls of this scene will be crashing at you
you left senseless mentally unfit
never fucking heard from you again
never fucking heard from again voice is a weapon; bombs are away
minds a trigger, fire away
worlds in a crossfire, of panic and fear
the war is upon us; i say it starts here

we will take control
of this abortion called society
i despise the mediocrity
inject the system with something new
a social terror to lead the few

why call it the land of the free?
political banter, if you ask me
diffusing a problem, the question is how
with imminent conflict, the answer starts now

i can say
were not the answer to the worlds decay
here to stay
were just the ones who wont go away

we will take control
of this disaster called society
i despise the mediocrity
so now im going to introduce
a social terror thats on the loose


i am the propaganda war machine
the face of fury and obscenity
so when society has gone astray
ill be the one to pave the way
theyll never fuck with my reality
cause this right here to me is unity
when all is done, well have always shown
a domination that was never known

we will take control
of this abortion called society
i despise the mediocrity
we are the torch that lights the fuse
a social terror with nothing to lose even though some things are better left unsaid
theres a few things i need to get off my chest
i need to vent, let me tell you why

im suicidal, maniacal, self-destructive
you leave me no hope, no life
nothing worth living for
ive taken it, cant take it anymore
my worst nightmare
you make me want to slit my own fucking throat
just so ill be rid of you
just to get rid of you

you self-righteous fuck
give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off
why dont you take a good look in these eyes
cause im the one thats gonna tear your fucking heart out
my hate is contagious, youve got no one to run to
exile
exile
exile
exile

just tell me fucking why everything becomes an issue
your opinion is always senseless, fuck this
you make my fucking skin crawl
ive lived with it, cant stand anymore
my worst nightmare
i want to take a bullet in the fucking head
every time i think of you
every time i think of you

you self-righteous fuck
give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off
why dont you take a good look in these eyes
cause im the one thats gonna tear your fucking heart out
my hate is contagious
anyone else need to vent?
youve tried my tolerance, i just want you to die


theres nothing more for me to say
theres nothing more for you to say
theres nothing more for us to say
i fucking hate you anyway
exile
exile
exile
exile

cant count the ways that you light my fuckin fuse
i cant tolerate the sight of you, the thought of you
or anything about you
you know what i want to see?
how many ways can a loser fucking lose?
i know youll find a way
the humility awakening the idiot inside
you spineless fucking maggot, youre just wasting my time
get out of my face, get out of my life
out of my fucking way, just die evangelist, you claim god speaks through you
your restless mouth, full of lies, gains popularity
you care not for the old that suffer
when empty pockets cry from hunger

penniless from their generosity
sharing their money to quench your greed
searching for the answer to their prayers
they cry their last wish of need
save me

his spirit lives and breathes in me
the almighty transformed to your screen
the meanings lost in its translation
no holy words, describe his deception

you say youll help us find the lord
tell me, preacher, how do you know?
a simple quest for a visible savior
to lead us through our final prayer
save me

send your donations, contribute to the cause
luxuries, your righteous reward
praise the lord, praise god, is what you wish to sell
there is no heaven without a hell


in your minds eye, could you truly believe
that by giving, you can save your soul
could you be so naïve?
you heal the sick, you raise the dead
you blind the congregation
with the things you say
religious blackmail, a deceit of trust
that death will come and all will be lost
can you hear the serpents call
look deep in those deceiving eyes
ignore the writing on the wall
you should read between the lies

when doubt subsides his honesty
an inquiry, is it blasphemy?
impure the soul, thats made to suffer
no sermons left to hide or cover
an empty promise, lie unfulfilled
to steal a dream or get it killed
they claim your trip to heavens nearby
you may believe it but satan wouldnt lie i never thought the taste of you would be the only thing to make me bleed
why am i so alive while you lay still in the ground beneath me?
fear of death the dark inside
have become your only children
theyre in front of you
watching you
lost screams, unholy dreams, unrest
i laugh at your god as hes passing through
slicing at your throat to warm my skin
never thought itd come to this
what the fuck?
ive gone wrong no rest
your children still call
cant you hear them screaming out your name?
youve gone insane
theyre in my head
they want you to die in front of me, die in front of me
thinking why me?
wishing this was all a dream
insanity, reality
youre going to die in front of me
pestilence is here
death awaits
your body is not of christ
its my alter
helpless and alone
violate
enveloped in my skin
faceless canvass
tearing at your flesh
bathed in blood
violently regress
deaths so endless
brutal is your pain
anguish is a game
broken and afraid
god cant help you now
youll wish you were in hell 
ghostly figures are always standing still
are they mocking me?
what do they see?
i didnt want your death to end so fast
but once you start, you cannot stop
i need it now to fucking last
die in front of me
die in front of me
thinking why me?
wishing this was all a dream
insanity, reality
youre going to die in front of me
pestilence is here
death awaits
your body is not of christ
its my alter
brutal is your pain
anguish is a game
broken and afraid
god cant help you now

youll wish you were in hell 
i never thought the taste of you would be the only thing to make me bleed
all alone in my funeral home
playing in blood
theres just got to be
somethings wrong with me
draining veins
its all the same
the torture in my head
it wont stop until i am fucking dead
pestilence is here
death awaits
your body is not of christ
its my alter
helpless and alone
violate
enveloped in my skin
faceless canvass
tearing at your flesh
bathed in blood
violently regress
deaths so endless
brutal is your pain
anguish is a game
broken and afraid
god cant help you now
youll wish you were in hell  come walk with me through endless time
see what has been and what the future sees
share the wisdom of the old world that has passed
step in a life thats yet to be born

you spill the blood
eternal soul

ill show you sights that you would not believe
experience pleasures thought unobtained
at one with evil that has ruled before
now smell the stench of immortality

you spill the blood
eternal soul


spill your blood, let it run on to me
take my hand and let go of your life
close your eyes and see what is me
raise the chalice, embrace for evermore

youve spilt the blood
ill have your soul high velocity bullet at close range
can damage the mind
shattering the skull, shredding the brain
severing the spine
bury a round of lead in the chest
its quite an impression
imagine the innards of your soul
the infliction

instinctive regression
with intent to kill
no regard of human life
or the blood spilled


riddled convulsions
confetti of flesh
scattered helplessly
losing your control of physical facilities
release the slide to cleanse inside
prepare to anoint
snap the tongue in the groove discharge
to make my hallowed point

instinctive regression
with intent to kill
no regard of human life
or the blood spilled

power of a gun
used with conviction
dispersed on excursions
randomly kills its victims
my sweet revenge
bitter in depression
the thrilling release
of a hatred deep persuasion


the power of a gun
used with conviction
diffused compulsions
unending repercussions
violent emotion
screaming revulsion
spasmatic convulsions
death an empty gun stop and think of societys impotence
and the reason behind its incompetence
faith in god is the vice, bring on the tyranny
wont be long til you find the real irony

life drags on, and we watch it bleed
on controversy and madness we feed
its a rush you cant deny
a little violence is the ultimate drug
lets get high

politician that claims to be the innocent
sells you peace then defies you with his insolence
greed and power his vices give him what he seeks
manipulate and divide forever lead the weak

life drags on, and we watch it bleed
on controversy and madness we feed
its a rush you cant deny
a little violence is the ultimate drug
lets get high

youve been powerless to your vices
self-control defies you
when nothing else quite suffices
your demons will destroy you

holy man portrays the face of purity
hiding behind as shroud of vanity
pure lust is his vice a sickness to defile
god becomes a device to hide the pedophile

life drags on, and we watch it bleed
on controversy and madness we feed
its a rush you cant deny
a little violence is the ultimate drug
lets get high

so fuckin high
lets get high!
lets get high! afraid to walk the streets
in the coldness, all alone
the blackness of the night
engulfs your flesh and bones
hoping for relief
from the fear you feel inside
losing all perspective
of reality in the night

running from shadows
blinded by fear
the horror of nightfall
is ever so near
i slowly surround you
as terror sets in
are you afraid of the night?

i see the fright in your eyes
as you turn and run
but is your mind playing tricks
on a body so very young?
feeling as if no one cares
the fear runs down your spine
but i know ill never rest
until i know youre mine

running from shadows
blinded by fear
the horror of nightfall
is ever so near
i slowly surround you
as terror sets in
are you afraid of the night?

too late to hide
too late to save your life
tormentor join in my quest to leave life overturned
spanning the world wave of doom
spewing out death with the evil ive churned
awaken the dead from their tombs
love turns to lust, the sensations ive felt
exploring the pleasures of sin
making the best of the cards ive been dealt
adjusting the odds so i win

unleash all my burning wrath
potential killing machine
take down all who block my path
enjoying all thats obscene, born of fire

prince of all darkness initiation
ritually baptized in flames
next to the throne, my abomination
spread terror throughout my domain
master the art that controls the impure
inherit the infamous keys
thousands of centuries i will endure
tyrant of all prophecies

some have called me satans son
a name i cannot deny
wielding fury thats second to none
far too vile to confine, born of fire


all things dead must rise again
when twilights blanket falls
splattered red, youll find my den
blood dripping from the walls
dreams born of desire
shaped, forged within the fire
twisted, warped, deranged i see
the worlds corrupt insanity


dreams possess nightmarish figures
burning, cant escape the embers
lost are those who trust the liar
satans son, im born of fire metal and men clash once more to the end
warriors above, with the power to kill, descend
militia of blood, troops of hate march to die
soldiers of hell, veterans of death arise

prepare for attack
your body will burn
endless war
theres no return
prepare for attack
death will arrive
your orders are clear
no way to hide

endless war

prepare for attack
death will arrive
your orders are clear
no way to hide

scepters of hate are dropped upon this earth
clouds of terror destroy all hope of rebirth

your body will burn
endless war

the hangman of prague
seven keys to the chamber
surrendered to the god
hunting

golden door submits secrets
as this nation falls
atmosphere of deadly terror
subservient to all
hunting
fighting
killing whore
wade through blood and bleed some more
hunting
fighting
killing whore
wade through blood and spill some more
burning sense of mission
assassination
symbol of oppression
crusade from exile
obliteration
sabotaged campaign
czech resistance from afar
planning the death of one
when the plot is executed
there will be nowhere to run
ramifications will be high
a price paid in torment
the end justifies the means
to hell you will be sent

the wolf leader now is the stalked
expansion state of horror
guns echo over the grave
a thousand fates are sealed
murderous power brought to an end
only to rise again
cold and ruthless and iron will
protectorate of the dead

a thorough sweep
prelude to death
secrets kept
but no one left
firing squad
begins their work
harsh reprisal
for what you took
retribution selective terror
the stench of death is everywhere
a severed head
a floating mass
will give me the answers to what i ask the traitor stands within the wolves lair
body count now imminent
the tension will rise, the air is on fire
this nightmare will not go on
prophecy has touched my hand
the outcome starts here and now
raise the flag as it burns
this nations blood will not be lost

take the war
taste the blood
attack and continue
never surrender
we shall be victorious
attack, continue, never
never surrender

your body will hang, piano wire plays
the music will relieve you
so delicate and lifeless now
is innocence victorious?
do you think i wont touch your grave?
devotion to all insane
if war is lost, you will die before i
without dignity for all to see

take the war
taste the blood
attack and continue
never surrender
we shall be victorious
attack, continue, never
never surrender


the terror wont end without you, my friend
this philosophy dreams of murder
liquidated down painless face
death has come no one to mourn
who will scream when all are gone?
not for love, for the enemy
fanatical zeal will bring this to an end
divine providence the worlds end

drink the war
piano wire plays
your body hangs
piano wire plays

take the war
taste the blood
attack and continue
never surrender
we shall be victorious
attack
never surrender mankind, in his insatiable search for divine knowledge
has discarded all biblical teachings
realizing that the strength of religion
is the repression of knowledge
all structures of religion have collapsed
life prays for death
in the wake of the horror of these revelations
it was never imagined how graphic the reality
that would be known as the end of creation
would manifest itself
we believe all this chaos and atrocity can be traced
back to one single event

we hold these truths to be painfully self-evident
all men are not created equal
only the strong will prosper
only the strong will conquer
only in the darkness of christ have i realized
god hates us all
god hates us all i am the last of the dying insane
you would scream at the things ive done
knowing now that the dead still see
my blood it runs like mercury
your last breath the sword comes down
she dies first speaking death to me
philosophy, the vision, the view within
duty, science, abstract cruelty
what are your final thoughts?
do you want to kill me or die in shame?
from my point of view
justified action, the enemy burns
the fun of massacre in the brain
bio-weapons and i are the same
look at their face, hatred in their blood
pile up the dead, my humanity
x-rays burn all that you can see
nobody knows what a body can stand
skulls on fire yet mercy is worse
you seek only your pleasure in death
what are your final thoughts?
do you want to kill me or die in shame?
from my point of view
justified action, the enemy burns
bacterial target, eyes exploding
melting flesh through your mind
become your madness insanity wins
infants flesh on the walls
testing limits, threshold of pain
ripping out teeth to observe
i want blood!

knowing now the dead still see
my blood it runs like mercury
knowing now the dead still see
my blood it runs like mercury
knowing now the dead still see
my blood it runs like mercury
knowing now the dead still see
my blood it runs like mercury
human brain experiment
on prisoners, open skull
vivisection, live dissection
repulsing to the core
what are your final thoughts?
do you want to kill me or die in shame?
from my point of view
justified action, the enemy burns
fuckin burns!
pathogens seek a horrible end
churning factories of death
crematoriums see your crime
you will see me in hell when war cries echoing all begin
never know any other way to fight, just win
blood of the enemy when penance is due
you know that sacrifice starts with you!

cast the first stone
stand in my way
its vengeance you owe
with blood, you will pay!

i live for battle the intensity knows no peer
your defiance will prove severe
choking on blood, beaten in pain
realizing the fighting is all in vain

cast the first stone
stand in my way
its vengeance you owe
with blood, you will pay!
when war cries echo sacrifice is you!


can feel that sweeping everywhere i walk?
like a devastating fire every time i talk!
man infested component you cant stop
a block of granite on my shoulder you cant knock off!

cast the first stone
stand in my way
its vengeance you owe
with blood, you will pay! eyes upon me
watching me in my perpetual sleep
dreams deceive me
my future depends on a mindless dream

ive fallen from promises
damned to take risks on my own
the masterful science that freezes your
mind and your soul

the wretched dream is realized
the human race is to be crystallized

thoughts of laughter
filling the head of the master in charge
worlds of wonder
is this a cure or a painless death?

ill fight and resist
till they all see the end that is near
the doctors the lawyers and demons
are living in fear

living my life with one distant hope
a cure that will kill this invincible foe unbound gods creation
has grown into the sinner
abandoned innocence
impenitent transgressor
escape mortality
they say your life can change
if you take gods hand
embrace rebirth
your cleansings so divine
to be reborn in gods eyes

youll never touch gods hand
youll never taste gods breath
because youll never see the second coming
lifes too short to be focused on insanity
ive seen the ways of god
ill take the devil any day
hail satan


your faith has atrophied
and rots in hells asylum
despondence tears you down
a free-falling social stain
escape atrocity
they say your life can change
if you take gods hand
embrace rebirth
your cleansings so divine
to be reborn in gods lies

youll never touch gods hand
youll never taste gods breath
because youll never see the second coming
its all a fuckin mockery
no grasp upon reality
its mind control for
compulsory religion and the skeleton christ

youll never touch gods hand
youll never taste gods breath
because youll never see the second coming
i laugh at the abortion known as christianity
ive seen the ways of god
ill take the devil any day
hail satan


youll never touch gods hand
youll never taste gods breath
because youll never see the second coming
its all a fuckin mockery
no grasp upon reality
its mind control for compulsory religion
mind control for compulsory religion
mind control for compulsory religion and the skeleton christ endure the pain
you know my name
i am your soul insane
i am no one
no one who cares
i am your soul despair
your fear deceives
vulnerability
leaving an easy prey
consume your mind
a power so divine
will take you and rape you blind

gemini master of demise
your death is my salvation
to a kingdom mine
my lord is my light
the master of darkness
your death is my salvation
to a kingdom mine

you look at me with eyes of fate
and see the graphic truth
your ignorance cannot shield you
from your naked abuse
numbing of your moral sense
facing reality
that life is unconditional
and death is only the beginning
the pain will never end...

walking slow, breathing heavy
you could see death sweat
how it shined
an argument out of control in my mind
i am here for the sole purpose of your death
walking slow breathing heavy
you can see death sweat
i am here for the sole purpose of your death
look into my eyes and see the revelation of your demise
feel the pain that stares at the center of your heart
reflections of my soul
reflections of the dark a soldiers heart
reflecting back at me
i keep seeing mutilated faces
even in my dreams
distorted images
flashing rapidly
psychotically abusing me
devouring my brain

the eyes of the insane
on a demented campaign

tortured spirits
will not let me rest
these thoughts of mutilated faces
completely possessed
fragmented images
flashing rapidly
psychotically abusing me
whirling through my head

shellshocked, battle fatigue
overwhelming anxiety
flashbacks. panic attacks
death raising its ugly face at me

got to make it stop
cant take it any more
the dead keep haunting me
they just keep coming back for more

the eyes of the insane
on a demented campaign
flashbacks, panic attacks
death raising its ugly face at me

got to make it stop
cant take it any more
deaths face keeps haunting me
and just keeps coming back for more


got to make it stop
cant take it any more
deaths face keeps haunting me
and just keeps coming back for more

a soldier
of misfortune
i owe my pain and suffering
to this hell
these demons
ripping through my soul
evils relentless hostility
wont let me sleep

shellshocked, battle fatigue
devastating insanity
flashbacks. panic attacks
deaths riding, hes coming for me deceased in mind, decree of death
blackened heart baptized in fire
exertion, now need to blitz
vicious ways brought up in hell
draw the line, life or death
potent thrust, excessive pain
massive dose, adrenaline
minor threat cannot decline

stricken to live, hell on earth
shackled and bound, we lie
praise of death, lifes a dream
were only living to die

victim of life, insanity lives
deep in shock, intensive care
tables turned, blast of strength
kill at once, time to prevail
begin to crank, feel the rush
start to rage, take to extremes
push too far, overkill
time to die, no way to win

stricken to live, hell on earth
shackled and bound, we lie
praise of death, lifes a dream
were only living to die


running and hunting and slashing and crushing and
searching and seeing and stabbing and shooting and
thrashing and smashing and burning, destroying and
killing and bleeding and pleading, then death


at mach 10 velocity
pressure builds, cant take the strain
life blood flows to its grave
dripping sweat, death shall erase
time to think, time to breathe
feel the pulse, life will expire
surging speed, hell-a-fast
cardiac, cease to exist

stricken to live, hell on earth
shackled and bound, we lie
praise of death, lifes a dream
were only living to die i saw them all around today
they dont stop, they wont go away
they love the darkness in my eyes
help me find a way out when im lost within myself
lost within myself
when im lost within myself

they show me everything i need
theres nothing wrong with a little greed
never enough to satisfy
such a driving desire that burns inside
my life came with its own scars
i dont need you to tell me about your sorrow
i cant say ive seen it all
but i live for the things that keep me hollow

every day, i look into the mirror
staring back, i look less familiar
ive seen all seven faces
each one looks a lot like me

they all look like me
i never see them coming
but they show me more of myself
drawn into the depths
i never knew existed
launching me face first
into the pleasures of pure lust and greed

i am becoming all things envied, i am the excess
i want it all, more pain, more sex, more lies
more of everything


my life came with its own scars
i dont need you to tell me about your sorrow
i cant say ive seen it all
but i live for the things that keep me hollow

every day, i look into the mirror
staring back, i look less familiar
ive seen all seven faces
each one looks a lot like me
ive seen all seven faces
each one looks a lot like me
they all look like me

i am becoming all things envied, i am the excess
i want it all, more pain, more sex, more lies
more of everything have you ever felt the need
to see more than you can see
look into uncertainty
reflections of treachery
would you leave the world behind
endless life is here to find
i can interest you in lies
sell your soul for all it buys

play with your insanity
shatter your reality
pulsing in your blood

i can satisfy your greed
for now all your debts are free
i have all eternity
to quench all the death i breed
recreate the rules of play
from now things are done my way
none have ever won my game
crucified them all in flames

play with your insanity
shatter your reality
pulsing in your blood


have you ever danced with the devil
his temptation ever summoned you
ever penned your name in blood
let possession slowly swallow you
when you stand under full moonlight
the attraction mesmerizes you
have you ever wondered why
it seems that evil youre attracted to

reach out to my hand
step back in times sand
genetic wasteland
far beyond death caught
now youre mine
i am the master of your whipping time
the smile
on my lips
the look of horror on your face
self
justification
cant rid the sexual fascination
can
you deny
my face of pleasure the gleam in my eye
youre nothing
an object of animation
a subjective mannequin
beaten into submission
raping again and again
shackled
my princess
dangling in distress
here
to discipline
my sole purpose never ends
bleeding
on your knees
my satisfaction is what i need
the urge
to take my fist
and violate every orifice
youre nothing
an object of animation
a subjective mannequin
beaten into submission
raping again and again
slaves to my torment
scream to your hearts content
time and time again
pleasure in inflicting pain
power so insane
trying to circumvent
unadulterated battery
manipulated reality
god is dead - i am alive! body count
laid out mutilated
its your time to die
desolate
lure kill satisfaction
climax with your death
all alone
my prey intimidated
feed my lust for fear
dehumanise
cry out stimulated
your screams fill my soul
systematic death
a physical fear
psychopathy red
after death gratification
graphic dreams
played out insatiable
cant control the urge
innocence
drop dead suicidal
a pain that i posses
vindictive
past crimes insidious
this is my redemption
violate
force down penetrate
your eyes reflecting horror
systematic death
a physical fear
psychopathy red
after death gratification
perversion
slow death agonizing
stab around the eyes
flow of blood
warm taste brings me pleasure
eclipsing all reason
pushing sperm
in her imitation
painful act in vain
organs cooked, bled out potency
now i am complete
systematic death
a physical fear
psychopathy red
after death gratification you can never truly see
inside the ones you know
until youve found them near
the edge of self-control
all i hear are lies
youre lying to yourself
and everything is out of control
youre just a fuckin slave of discontent
im sick of watching you dig this hole

time waits for no one
wont stop, it cant be outrun
you know that pain in your head
wont stop til the desperation ends

youve found yourself chasing death
oblivious until the end
youll never stop chasing death

innocence, common sense, i dont see the relevance
of anything that youve got to say
parasite, socialite, youre never gonna win this fight
there is no fucking easy way out
no easy way out

i know i should have seen it all coming
but i had to find it out on my own
a whore to incompetence you hide behind
the shadow that once was your throne
control is a discipline even when
frustration just stands in your way
the throes of insanity feel just like
a war inside you every day


i know i should have seen it all coming
but i had to find it out on my own
a whore to incompetence you hide behind
the shadow that once was your throne
control is a discipline even when
frustration just stands in your way
the throes of insanity feel just like
a war inside you every day

time waits for no one
wont stop, it cant be outrun
theres just no way of knowing
how long? paranoias growing
cant stop the poison winning
please, just take away this feeling
you know that pain in your head
wont stop until the desperation ends

youve found yourself chasing death
oblivious until the end
youll never stop until youre dead

innocence, common sense, i dont see the relevance
of anything that youve got to say
parasite, socialite, youre never gonna win this fight
there is no fucking easy way out
no easy way out
no easy way out
no easy way out
no easy way out so is it just me
or everyone can see
the world drowning in its own blood
humanitys decline
dismantled over time
a fossil drying in the mud
its deception and the greed
that germinates the seed
of dissent growing all around
is this the beginning or the end
in darkness we descend
and i cant wait to see it all go down
standing room only all the world will attend
front row center to the ultimate end
mankind constantly parading its flaws
tangled in charades of the orthodox laws
like a firestorm raging out of control
ignorance of all has taken its toll
it seems that blame is your personal hell
dish it out to anyone but never yourself
implode, no resurrection of divine
implode, extermination of the swine
sick of this shit called policy
life support for a dead economy
brain dead leaders of the world conspire
acting with malice only fuels the fire
no wonder people of religion obsess
all it wants a man to do is confess
arrogance will never let the fools concede
you know youre gonna have to stand and watch them bleed
implode, cleansation of mankind
implode, extermination of the swine
so many still ask why
ive said a million times
theres nothing godly looking over us
its just the choice you make
ill still inject the hate
that brings finality to the fuss
society will bleed
so watch the violence breed
and deconstruct the protocol
and if im proven wrong
i think you know the song
im pretty sure that god still hates us all
standing room only all the world will attend
front row center to the ultimate end
mankind constantly parading its flaws
tangled in charades of the orthodox laws
no wonder people of religion obsess
all it wants a man to do is confess
arrogance will never let the fools concede
you know youre gonna have to stand and watch them bleed
implode, cleansation of mankind
implode, extermination of the swine
no resurrection of divine
extermination of the swine
its the cleansation of mankind
no resurrection of divine
extermination of mankind its the feel of your blood
as it flows smoothly down my skin
intoxicating my soul
immortality, seducing me
burning in your own hell, which now binds you to me infinitely
spirits of angels dont weep for you enticing me
vanity, blood
left for you to drink
eternity waits for you
vanity, blood
left for you to drink
eternity waits for you to drink
frozen in time is the ice flowing in your veins
are you insane?
at your mercy they suffered while you sat there painless
vile and shameless
crowned you are now for the merciless sins
its the end
your beauty through order is where blood flows through you
where it begins
vanity, blood
left for you to drink
eternity waits for you
vanity blood
left for you to drink
eternity waits for you to drink
young life striped down of all its dignity
sliced flesh pours out its youthfulness
my lust will never be fully quenched
your screams tell me that youre not prepared to die

creature from hell why cant you see the things i see?
mirror tells me that you were always meant for me
you are my sacrifice
blood is the deficit
biting the flesh, face my sick prelude
now meet your frozen death
god did not do this
heated iron bar i will insert inside your cunt
mistress of cruelty, a name that will not die
you are my sacrifice
blood is the deficit
bathing in blood, your heart, your soul, your god
it all belongs to me
god belongs to me
it all belongs to me

murder is my birthright the bloodline proves aristocracy
walled in, left for dead, your actions show no hypocrisy
my birthright, is murder
birthright, murder
birthright, murder i am the new hell on earth
the lord of agony divine
domination, intimidation
lives within these eyes
reign of power
remorseless anarchy
i am arrogance in the flesh
unleashed intensity

step aside for the nightmare
pure destruction stands before you
no escape as the psycho
brings you misery
the line starts here
the line starts here

i am brutality, the face of everlasting pain
annihilation, obliteration
pulses in these veins
sheer defiance drives my hostility
i am merciless to the core
chaotic fury breeds

step aside for the nightmare
pure destruction stands before you
no escape as the psycho
brings you misery
the line starts here
the line starts here

bring it all on
come and take on what you fear
im the storm
that towers overhead
ticking time bomb
with an infinite charge
bringer of torture
the master is here
everyone falls


here comes the pain
youre no different from the rest
victim is your name in my vicious wasteland
here comes the pain
your destruction manifests
lying there broken, looking up as i still stand

bring it all on
come and take on what you fear
im the storm
that towers overhead
ticking time bomb
with an infinite charge
bringer of torture
the master is here
everyone falls despair, emptiness
see the hatred wasted on yourself
face down, taste the dust, its getting harder everyday
just to find a reason not to end it all yourself
suicide on the street
everywhere around you watch it breed
it begins to bury you in self-induced rejection
so now youre wasted, broken down
i see through your ignorance
penetrate the surface of your insecure inside
next fix, shoot it up
looking for the place where god speaks
every time you find him
he just stabs you in the back again

no one hears you
youre societys infection
i wont judge you
when the blood steals life from you

cast down and thrown away
you are the living dead
the needle numbs the pain
of all your suffering
this is where the world of money changes nothing

just a statistic in the shadows of the real world
the systems failing you just the way it failed me
hell is home on the concrete where the city bleeds
america, home of the free, land of fucking disenchantment

despair, emptiness
isolation rapes you everyday
face down taste the dust, digging deeper in your grave
havent found a reason
havent found a thing to fucking live for
godless, he doesnt care
how you choose to destroy yourself
in a world that feeds on hate
youre left here just to waste away
in your cardboard prison, asphalt wasteland

no one hears you
youre societys infection
i wont judge you
when the blood steals life from you
no one sees you
youre societys infection
i wont judge you
when the blood steals life from you

cast down and thrown away
you are the living dead
the needle numbs the pain
of all your suffering
this is where the world of money changes nothing imagine humanitys decline
step inside my stain of mind
infesting superiority
infectious immorality, oh yeah
come worship the place no truths are told
praise the land where sins are sold
no passion no love your faith evades
never see yourself again that way

death becomes your bride
lifelessness invades your eyes
in fire baptized
all pain sifts through my soul
youll never feel greater misery
master of my enemy
let the purest stain of mind
wash the virtue from your eyes

as one the collective unifies
emanate a faithless shine
forever creation has conceived
birth of destruction spreads its wings, oh yeah
chaotic rebirth a new domain
re-live the sight the sound the pain
erotic the taste of agony
adorn the scars of inhumanity

this is what you see
deep inside of me
agony is life
lechery is life
godlessness is life
purgatory magnified
in fire baptized
all pain sifts through my soul
youll never feel greater misery
master of my enemy
let the purest stain of mind
wash the virtue from your eyes

enticing malevolence allures
bastardize the clean and pure
salvation forever crucified
i choose the other side, oh yeah
entire, complete serenity
injected intravenously
transgression euphoric bliss divine
initiate a timeless stain of mind

blood will sterilize
in fire i baptized
all pain sifts through my soul
youll never feel greater misery
master of my enemy
let the purest stain of mind
wash the virtue from your eyes take a deep breath
cause it all starts now
when you pull the fuckin pin
the shrapnel burns as it tears into the skin
ever wonder what it takes to be questioning your faith?
this is what its like when it happens every goddamn day
violence is our way of life
shards of life like confetti in the air
the flesh storm grows as it breeds despair
you hear screams in the distance fighting the resistance
not cries of war
these are just the sounds of pain

its all just psychotic devotion
manipulated with no discretion


killings in style and its now the main event
the cameras are whores for the daily bloodshed
like a junkie, hungry for a fix of anything
the media devours and feasts upon the inhumane
violence is our way of life
its all too fuckin clear we can never coincide
so lets all drink to genocide
all the venomous sights border on the arcane
in times of war, everything is bound by pain

its all just psychotic devotion
manipulated with no discretion

warfare knows no compassion
thrives with no evolution
unstable minds exacerbate un-rest (in peace)


theres no future, the world is dead
so save the last bullet for your head
only fallen have won
because the fallen cant run
my visions not obscure
for war there is no cure
so hear the only law
men killing men for someone elses cause

its all just psychotic devotion
manipulated with no discretion devious to those unknown
he walks below the land
alluring victims to their death
perish to the sand
master of the blackened arts
living his decree
thrives amongst the seven gates
searching for the keys

i have seen the darkened depths of hell
sorcery beyond the witches spell
robbed the crypts of deaths eternity
killed the priest and cursed him endlessly

chants of evil incantation
fill the murky night
free the devils knights of hell
unleash their growing spite
directing power forcibly
the fire of hell is cast
resurrect from crypts of death
a demon from the past

i have seen the darkened depths of hell
sorcery beyond the witches spell
robbed the crypts of deaths eternity
killed the priest and cursed him endlessly


cringe with fear
violate the unbroken seal of hell
death will come searching for
your mere soul
still you are eager to seek your fate
all that lie here are remains

grinding bones, screaming skulls
broken by the lapse of time
decay to powder, ashes to dust
diminishing, disintegrating
mans soul and mind


empty space tracks throughout
i make my claim


disease engulfs, covers the world
my kingdom, my domain you know the feeling
when adrenaline takes control
cant beat the rush
that leaves a suicidal hold
instinct spares no one
destroying the human heart
the taste of blood
can rip your soul apart
devils that drive us
do not discriminate
a state of mind
that becomes the ultimate end
action reaction
blood line is not immune
to the depth of human nature
inside of me and you
a sociopath with empty eyes
and no soul
paranoid psychotic heart of stone
my blood runs cold
evils of passion
can drive reason to extremes
love, hate and murder
temporary insanity
on the edge of a
demented personality
emotional
pain is a deadly reality
a sociopath with empty eyes
and no soul
paranoid psychotic heart of stone
my blood runs cold
a choice is made of free will
just like the choice to kill
decisions to lose control
my self-destructive rationale
a choice is made, made of free will
just like the choice, the choice to kill
in the speed of a moment
life stands still now youre standing in my killing field
a choice is made of free will
just like the choice to kill
in the speed of a moment
life stands still now youre standing in my killing field body that rests before me
with every dying breath
spellbound and gagged
i commence your flesh to dirt
body that lay before me
in everlasting death
entombed in an abscess
to rot and lie stinking in the earth


empty altar awaits its victim
stained glass windows black
candles burn the midnight oil
incense fills the night
observing trance awaking state
lying still unknowing
reciting the passages of time
prepare for the impaling


deaths an art, flesh and earth never part
a power of the mind
death shines on the air of silence
a ritual of endless time
purged of your dead body
sacrificed of your life
unearthly ritual sealed in fire
enter the kingdom of desire screams of terror across the sea
begging for mercy in their one final plea
soldiers prepare to fight to the death
fighting and killing to their very last breath

blitzkrieg tactics of the german command
born with the power of god in his hand
he makes his move to conquer the land
turning all hopes of life to sand

machine gun fire, blood level higher
visions of torture and terror to all
ready for battle, awaiting the final command

hiding in darkness from enemies unseen
awaiting our victory, ending his dream
cursed are the souls who defy his will
all of which are tortured and ruthlessly killed

blitzkrieg tactics of the german command
born with the power of god in his hand
shocking the world with his mass devastation
he puts all his power in the trust of one nation

machine gun fire, blood level higher
visions of torture and terror to all
ready for battle, awaiting the final command

at the crack of dawn, they storm again
hunting, fighting, and killing all men
our end is near, our time now short
our kingdoms have fallen as a result of his sport

blitzkrieg tactics of the german command
born with the power of god in his hand
withdrawn from fighting, he now takes his leave
seeking out goals that cant be conceived

machine gun fire, blood level higher
visions of torture and terror to all
ready for battle, awaiting the final command fear runs wild in the veins of the world
the hate turns the skies jet black
death is assured in future plans
why live if theres nothing there
spectors of doom await the moment
the mallet is sure and precise
cover the crypts of all mankind
with cloven hoof begone

sadistic minds
delay the death
of twisted life
malicious world

the crippled youth try in dismay
to sabotage the carcass earth
all new life must perish below
existence now is futile
decrepit breath
vile in its stench
a world in decay
transgressor is as one

sadistic minds
delay the death
of twisted life
malicious world


convulsions take the world in hand
paralysis destroys
nobodys out there to save us
brutal seizure, now we die

sadistic minds
delay the death
of twisted life
malicious world start with vanity
arrogance and greed
panic is my obsession
no one can escape
the thrill is much too great
despair is my creation
everything obscene
emanates from me
homicide is on the rise
it all begins now

horrid thoughts that surface to me
ceremony bloods command
i will live through this forever
i have done the things you grieve
as you kneel before its evil
death is here deep inside your

skinned alive. now naked
terrorized, no humanity
seek salvation from an mia god
empty vessels chanting for your death

walk the streets beneath the shadows
searching for a cryptic bride
eat alive the conscience i hate
without pain i watch you die
i will live through this forever
i have done the things you grieve
as you kneel before its evil
my face is the last youll see

soaked in blood, the mask you wear
haunting cries, the dead scream for me
staring eyes invoke no guilt
i can taste your mind, your lifeless

face the dead and dying
feel your life drain through your soul
seek salvation from an mia god
empty vessels chanting for the dead


death is yours, your veins have dried
staring eyes of glass, now empty
still you speak with lips so cold
in my head i hear you cry

god is dead, cant save me
taking lives with impunity
resurrection of a deviant christ
feeding hate to capacity
deviance initiate blood purge
coalition in massacre
mechanized high tech
wholesale death in effect
mutually assured
destruction will occur
genocide revised
same pain through diverse eyes
cant stop the warring factions
cant stop the warring factions
hostile from the start
always war always
ending bitter peace
not the last third war
blood spills forevermore
patriot hard line
lay siege till the end of time
no longer kill your brother
just slaughter one another
watch for the deadly other
this sibling is a fucker
cant stop the warring factions
cant stop the warring factions
global tension starts aggression
peace breaks out then
breeds contempt unrest

without a reason to fight
a time to kill
sick lust for skeletal flesh
a taste for all decay
enter the soldier blind
stalking the faceless hunt
there is no conscience in this world
that can be reached for peace
why face the human question
the need to hate
dead stare through cynical eyes
a trust in only pain
murder within the skin
engrave the art of war
become deaths vile parade
march on, embrace the violent mind
cant stop the warring factions
cant stop the warring factions
global tension starts aggression
peace breaks out then
breeds contempt unrest
one cryptic reason for life murder let me take you down without a sound
dead before you hit the ground
blood washes my hand cant understand
sterilizing my pain
washed away with crimson tide
by my hand i keep testing time
quench the fire that drives my soul
soothing me as death takes hold

peaceful and serene slowly bleeding
eyes once bright are now fading
pallid ashen face against my skin
staring blindly at some distant place
washed away by crimson tide
by my hand i keep testing time
straight flesh lace adorns your neck
spilling your blood all over my flesh
quench the fire that drives my soul
soothing me as death takes hold
divine godsend enveloping me
spiritual ecstasy sets me free with our callous minds we infect
other ways of life no regrets
like a masochist we instigate
while the rest of the world must tolerate
americon, its all about the mother fucking oil
regardless of the flag upon its soil
in a blood bath we pad our fucking greed
the price is high to maintain liberty

that imprison the minds of the weak
no immunity for swaying the odds
from this resistance strain americon

the crystal ball shows unknown fate
the last thing thats heard is the screams

ghosts from hell invade this feeble shrine
heavens holy house will fall in time
satans morbid soldiers chant in lust

attacking angels as they pray to god
tormented preachers hail the twisted cross
haunting the chapel, hells demons prevail
death has come, the house of god has failed attitude is my addiction

issue transfusion no one left to blame
natures way of thinning out the human fucking herd
disease, to war to fear his own kind
the human strain, returning plague
drink the tainted blood
from the only child
cities, increase speed population rise
dying, the future process in the genes
death stalking man as he embraces the absurd
through peace, through life, the hatred of himself
the human strain, returning plague
drink the tainted blood
from the only child
death stalking man though peace, through life, though hatred of himself
death stalking man, as he embraces his crucifixion
skinless resurrection, from the bodies of the dead
sickness is increasing, as the oceans turn red
apparatus for self destruction, day of judgement is now at hand
decayed memories haunt vaccinated minds
risk contamination mechanism of death
anyone left alive scorch turn to ash

the human strain, returning plague
drink the tainted blood

theres nothing to it
forget about god

we live by a system
of perfect goals
people vs. people who are bored and old
life must rest on the man who represents
looking for nothing in this
campus with just friends

the highest man on the government table
superficial love only for a fuck
but love is incest and its only for a fuck

president clinton can suck my motherfuckin dick surrender your cloth and collar, priest
theres no need for your beliefs in war
this is a place for heathens
into that darkness, fires illuminate
grotesquely swollen by the heat
a half-burned corpse hanging naked
a stream is poisoned by the dead
in the  ghostly light, debris of war

lead us to the brink of extinction
the time has come for you now to finish it
what has man become, a funeral pyre
now that judgements near, prepare to die
need to suffer, lust for power, mindless hunger, never win
final six is here, the cycle ends


i have come for you my child
and the gift i bring is murder
sumerian death in eastern winds
face the father of your terror
godless warheads wait to breathe
set their sights on history
distant silhouettes of the dead
blackened face screams through the ashes

lead us to the brink of extinction
the time has come for you now to finish it
what has man become, a funeral pyre
now that judgements near, prepare to die
need to suffer, lust for power, mindless hunger, never win
final six is here, the cycle ends


mankind owes his pain to hell
as he brings the end upon himself
arms rising from the ashes
in the ghastly light of human flares
berith soldiers capture souls
shadows of human sacrifice
the return of everything thats dead
a cryptic promise from the heavens

lead us to the brink of extinction
the time has come for you now to finish it

dead flowers for a faceless dead
a city engulfed by the smell of the death
bodies piled beneath the mist
walking dead among the living
the world will bleed while horsemen ride
now that god has wept for judas
days are numbered, find your grave
forever trying to escape to hell deaths pointed at your head
your minds on the trigger pull it
bludgeon bodies give up their muted horror story
scene of your rage
death is not strange
blood on the walls
you stand alone satisfied

ill wake the silence in you
ill shoot the violence

terrified by the thought that you are all alone
paralyzed by the fact that you are not alone
youre losing your mind, im losing control
youre losing your mind, as i bury your world

ill wake the silence in you
ill shoot the violence in you

i cant remember yet someone always seems to die
you are the reason why i became the chosen one
ive got the right
god makes no sense
ive got the right
i feel my back against the wall
the fuckin wall


deaths pointed at your head
your minds on the trigger pull it
bludgeon bodies give up their muted horror story
scene of my rage
scene of my rage
death is your name
youre facing your grave

i taste your tears caress your face
i watch you lie insane
dying for love
praying to die
i want whats inside you
dressed in your blood
you wear it well
dying because i care
your eyes are wide but you cant see
rotting my lust away
ill shoot the violence through you
and wake the part thats dead
i hate the silence in you
i want whats in your head fear is just interpretation
feeds my motivation
our time together is
a bloodbath of serenity
plead no more
theres no confusing the finale
excitation
my rancid passion is electrified

accept this
my religion of torture
i cant see any purity
just imperfection and obscenity
my blood soaked hands devise
your slow methodic demise
asphyxiate the world
its blind without me

catatonic
catatonic
im numb in priceless solitude
exhilarating keeping pieces of you near


visions of decapitation
my mental masturbation
i try to resurrect
your consciousness, your intellect
once so pure
your pain excites and tests me
excitation
the empty stare emitting from your eye

embrace it
my religion of torture
all i see are the impurities
the imperfections and obscenities


accept this
my religion of torture
excitation
the rancid passion coming from your eyes
my blood soaked hands devise
your slow methodic demise
asphyxiate the world
its blind without me

catatonic
catatonic
im numb in priceless solitude
exterminating all the voices multitudes
i cant stop because its so hypnotic
catatonic crisis feeds the lunacy
all fear the new machine
consumed democracy returns a socialist regime
its laid to rest without contest
all hail the new incompetence
making you see what to believe
a drone in the world of anarchy
treachery, mysery, violence, insanity
scavengers closing in
covering the truth again
castrate society
fictional reality
insecurity afraid of things you cannot see
words become the image of the enemy
you cannot dissect what is correct
vengeance based on how things are said
cant see your side - conflicts with mine
frustrations lead to complete demise
treachery, mysery, violence, insanity
scavengers closing in
covering the truth again
every trial conspiracy
compassion is the enemy
paralyse, criticize
breaking through the wall of lies
suicidal hierarchy racing in reverse
everything thats done today will be tomorrows curse
screams in my head preceed your death
cant hold the rage when the truth is shed
blind lead the blind line after line
in a world too shallow to defy
treachery, mysery, violence, insanity
scavengers closing in
covering the truth again
castrate society awake each day
to propaganda written to persuade
complacency, conformity
relentless madness they regurgitate
so save your breath, you cant coerce the strong with verbal warfare
defending, bludgeoning, to succumb to christ or they will
watch you fucking burn, these apocalyptic predators must die
everyone til none are left alive, ill eradicate the weak
within this war, cuz im the fucking weapon, im not, not of this god

replicate, like a virus that infects with disease
the beckoning pestering, dont preach to me with your blasphemy
exterminate, the bottom dweller on your fear they prey
theres symmetry in anarchy, believe the lies or they will watch you
fuckin burn, these apocalyptic predators must die
everyone til none are left alive, ill eradicate the weak
within this war, cos im the fucking weapon, im not, not of this god
false god, sorcerer, free thought torturer, embedded in the mind of the masses
outcast, conjurer, spineless provocateur, engulfed in narcissistic madness
no need to feel so hollow, a promise of no sorrow, you call him the messiah
i seek a deviant pariah

holy water empty threat, the holy cross has no effect
i piss on any object of virtue, crucifix and rosaries
a world of insecurities, keep waiting for your soul to be rescued
youll see no bright tomorrow, a promise of more sorrow
you call him the messiah, i see a reckless fashion based on metal slavery

you are the tainted, i am the pure, you are the sickness
i am the cure, a toxic threat of your non sense, i feed
ill be the one to bring christ to his knees, crucify then ridiculed again
a target for all time, until the end
ill expose a total inconsistencies, and wallow in my heresy
cos i am the fucking weapon, attacker of their ideology
intoxicate with rationality, these apocalyptic predators must die
cos i am the fucking weapon, im not, not of this god enter my mind can you stop the rage
no one shall mourn or pity my grave
fighting the world without remorse
searching for blood to never grow old
a personal hell is where i reside
taunting death sounds cadavers in pain
judging my soul i am not his son
screaming gods name i want some more

you love to hate me
but you wont kill me
suicidal surge
desensitize the world

take what i want primordial ground
humanity bleeds from inside my veins
losing all grasp an evil so old
vengeance it breeds driving you insane
exhaust all will hanging by the neck
anguish within let it blind the eyes
better off dead is your epitaph
apathy feeds the human demise

absolute reign a malevolent mind
conceptions so vile in this bottomless soul
shooting up hate nothing beats the rush
total addicting, corrupt and profane
force-fed lies in this chapel of lust
dancing in blood disciples enslaved
putrefied walls adorned with your flesh
coating this shrine of the ungodly cross

you love to hate me
but you wont kill me
suicidal surge
desensitize the world


enter my mind can you stop the rage
no one shall mourn or pity my grave
fighting the world without remorse
searching for blood to never grow old
absolute reign a malevolent mind
conceptions so vile in this bottomless soul
putrefied walls adorned with your flesh
coating this shrine of the ungodly cross

you love to hate me
but you wont kill me
suicidal surge
desensitize the world its the terror that youve gotta miss
and i wanna see you right in front of death
your eyes will shine
were all alone and there is no noise
step into my shadow
with no remorse
with no remorse you aint gotta die
the loudest noise cant make me happy
come on, bastards, feels so good
the records coming out, baby
with no remorse i want to die
no remorse
with no remorse i wanna die
"remain calm, im coming to your house to kill you"
i cant come down
no remorse
with no remorse i wanna die
what you want me to do?
what you want me to do?
no remorse cause i wanna die
no remorse
with no remorse i wanna die terrorize, frozen eyes stare deep in me
paralyzed inside, death breeds on your pain
pretty lace lie in hate, you wear my scars
terrified, you find that you push me too far
your repulsiveness reminds me of dead flesh
rotting corpse the smell of your putrid fucking soul

petrified that i decide the moment of your death
belongs to me, the taste is sweet, its so unreal
your god weeps, it bleeds, it begs for me
god is letting you recover


welcome to my black serenade
the entrance to my hell, your pain
scream your song, the black serenade
live in fear, a mind insane

voice inside my head
your face still shows itself to me
telling me youre dead
staring at your lifeless body
i saw you fucking die
my minds tearing itself apart
screaming from the inside
release this pain from my fucking heart

destroy the empty shell
smash away the haunting fear
i hate your endless stare
watching as i fuck your corpse

welcome to my black serenade
the entrance of my hell, your pain
walk through a tortured mind
youll scream your song in time

welcome to my black serenade
the entrance to my hell, your pain

youll scream your song in time

welcome to my black serenade
entrance to my hell, your pain
flesh is burnt, the black serenade
live in fear, death and back i need to redefine
all the things i hate today
politics that fail
from a president derailed
i hate the shit economy
it might as well be sodomy
i know that in the end
im expected to pretend

but i cant relate
to your verbal idiocy
no ones in control
when the governments the enemy


so light the fuse
impose your views
consfearacy
is anarchy

actions of hostility
breeds conformity
annihilation will begin
extermination from within

so light the fuse
impose your views
consfearacy
is anarchy


i need to redefine
how i see the world today
seems that all the war
didnt even up the score
its only mind pollution
there is no resolution
still i know that in the end
im expected to pretend
that i cant think for myself
blame it all on someone else
half-hearted smile
while you look the other way

i cant relate
to your verbal idiocy
no ones in control
when the governments the enemy

so light the fuse
impose your views
consfearacy
complacency is your demise i wont cover your eyes
i want your innocence
glisten before me in a cold sweat
i want you to see your lie spill on me
spill on me

manifested as a primitive craving
the craving never seems to go away
i want to see the face of everyone fall
fall into the cold embrace of death

youre in my nightmare
i decide when it stops
its my fucking drug
makes my rush intensify
hardcore, the overdose
your fear gets me high

unbound, im the weapon made to sterilize
sterilize all the idiot victims
anytime, anywhere, anyone i want
everyones addicted to this torture

im the agony in every breath
every breath brings you closer to me
youll do anything, anything
youll do anything to make it stop

youre in my nightmare
i decide when it stops
its my fucking drug
makes my rush intensify
chaos deep inside, it makes me

it makes me feel surreal
it makes me need to kill
it makes me feel surreal
it makes me need to kill

do you want to feel eternity?
your eternity lies within me
i am the terror of your final breath
your final breath brings light to my darkness

like an act of fucking god unleashed
on the innocence, innocence of mankind
youll do anything, anything
youll do anything to make it stop

its my fucking drug
makes my rush intensify
hardcore fucking overdose
your fear gets me off like fuck

it makes me feel surreal
it makes me need to kill
it makes me feel surreal
it makes me need to kill
it makes me feel surreal
it makes me need to kill
it makes me feel surreal
it makes me need to kill
it makes me feel surreal
it makes me need to kill
it makes me feel surreal
it makes me need to kill needles stabbed into the walls
the executioners curtain call
fighting back he found his identity
and there was no way out
cause richard hung himself
richard hung himself
it happened just the other day
jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
he thought he find a better way
with slashing, and stabbing, and maiming and ramming
death threw his black curtains
where his clothes once lied
the roof kicked out and the rope tied to the rafters
a quick kick of the chair
and it was all through
if richie only knew
cause richard hung himself
richard hung himself
it happened just the other day
jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
he thought he find a better way
with needles, injecting and shooting subcutaneously
his life suddenly flashed right before his eyes
what a swinging guy
turning gray with mold
this is when he died
give it up 
throw it all away
burning acid bath
pulmonary wrath
feel the boiling surge
it wont let you go
throw it all away 
throw it all a....... 
throw it all away
swinging in his room
richie wont come out to play
that poor bastard hung himself the other day
oh how the years seem to fly by
is death the final high
cause richard hung himself
richard hung himself
it happened just the other day
jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
he thought he find a better way
with slashing and stabbing and ripping
and stabbing and shredding and slashing
and shredding and stabbing and ripping
and tearing attacking and maiming
and taking the body that god gave to you
i gotta get out
cause richard hung himself (cause richard hung himself)
cause richard swung himself (cause richard hung himself)
cause richard strung himself (cause richard hung himself)
the needle, it stung itself (cause richard hung himself)
they pulled him right off the fucking shelf (cause richard hung himself)
that poor bastard, man he hung himself (cause richard hung himself)
to fucking think of himself cant explain the other side
answers lost before their eyes
violence surges from inside
a state of mind that never dies
born into a chosen way
life that doesnt fit today
to die a painful death it seems
is better than your misery
contemplating rearranging
changing all your ways of thinking
everyday you life seems like
its pushed into a hole
acting out anothers needs
to rule a soul eternally
adjusting to another set
of values takes its toll
growing in a lunacy
that plays on your stupidity
circle of beliefs
secrets never keep
living in a lie
right before your eyes
born without a brain
helpless is your name
all you do is pray
living is your pain
mentally so small you cant
accept another side
your point of view a memory
because it doesnt mean a thing
the resurrections waiting for
a world without sin
the temples will crumble
while awaiting for it to begin
circle of beliefs
secrets never keep
living in a lie
right before your eyes
losing is your way
mental disarray
i can see your strain
you dont want to be saved

cant you see no validity
must control silencing of souls
slow decay spreading through your brain
devastate the deviant will dominate
cant you see theres no validity
your way is not the only way
slow decay spreading through your brain
dont you see the power of the enemy
tyrants total supremacy
control the silencing of souls
slavery within the entity
devastate, dominate
cant explain the reason why
someone would rather live than die
if dying is the only way
to end a life of mental stains
all your life hes been the cause
a man impaled upon a cross
pure religious holocaust
if religion dies its not my loss

perception always biased feeding off a fallacy
your systematic way of life
decided for you every night
intentional conflicting words
avoid solidity
blinded by the holy light
that constantly consumes your mind
circle of beliefs
secrets never keep
living in a lie
right before your eyes
burning in my wake
souls are free to take
youre following a fake
everyone awake!!! cant stand -
the way you look
the way you talk
the way you act
cant stand you
do i think -
youre a dick - yeah
youre a fuck - yeah
well fight - yeah
do i think youll win - no
do i think youre stupid - yeah
do i think youre lame - yeah
am i stressing
youre the one to blame

i open my mouth at the wrong time
always ranking on somebody
im drunk all the time
throwing beer bottles and spitting in your face
checking through the purse
of the slut in our place
shell never notice if her money is gone
piss in her jacket
and just send her along unknown are the caverns of the mind
new realms of affliction lurk inside
unbound massive mental energy
your last breaths taken from you easily
incoherence disrupts your rationale
involuntary your last confessional
no sense of being missing segments of time
inconsistency is feeding on your mind

mind control, pain unfolds
i own all your sensations
weakening, reasoning
mesmeric full demolition
hypnotized - victimized
behold the threshold to the web
screaming souls fear echoes
piercing boundaries of the dead

penetration of the window to your soul
deterioration of the mind, no self control
temporarily comprehend no memories
hollow carcass of a man is all i leave
execution but a thought in the end
slowly erasing your life and what has been
passing victims in the land of secrecy
cerebral death can come to you in your dreams anarchy, disarray this is the world today
justice is a lie for the followers to get by
no peace, only guns, cant trust anyone
live or die its an eye for an eye
unrest, martial law, society decays
and its safe to say there is no other way
with lawless arrogance and savage dissidents
public display of dismemberment
blameless innocent, lies of the decadent
brazen hypocrites answering to idiots
new tax, market crash, high life never lasts
no quick fix, for broken politics
unrest, martial law, society decays
and its safe to say there is no other way
with lawless arrogance and savage dissidents
public display of dismemberment

aftermath of tolerance judgment is defined
individual pain is a strong incentive
infiltrate with fear keeping penance ever near
punish with indecency and mutilate for all to see

disarray, no quick fix, for broken politics
anarchy, live or die its an eye for an eye
unrest, martial law, society decays
and its safe to say there is no other way
with lawless arrogance and savage dissidents
public display of dismemberment i breach your life
indoctrinate
police your thoughts
ask why i hate
i lose control
when i see your face
abusing power
i infiltrate
continue lies
then masturbate
i walk the line
ill do no time
i hate your church
ill burn your state
a bleeding heart
a seal of fate
there is no crime
within my mind

ill sell your life and preach your death
a wicked plan born of contempt
bleeding my ideology through pain


audacious plans
i calculate
a new world view
ill re-instate
dont cross my path
or ill see you burn
youll meet your end
find death alone
no grave to mark
the seeds youve sown
youve pushed too far
my secrets i defend

ill sell your life and preach your death
a wicked plan born of contempt
bleeding my ideology through pain


demonize what is feared profane architect
skull and bones through the mind
barbaric thoughts of old
celebrate all unknown
at last the dead await
the die is cast for the meek
inherit endless dead time
smell the victims are near
consume the catalyst
hunting masses for game
implanting septic thoughts
reaping terror through words while
armed behind your back
pseudo leaders betray
enslaving all of mankind
cast out the demigod
dethrone the demagogue
cast out the church of god

i command your life
and i dont care
let bullets rain
from everywhere
no suicide
will save you from yourself no one could ever doubt my rapture
as you too will soon discover
no one will ever cross my love
deadly consequence will rise above

brutalitys the way of this world
branded and scarred, defy, defy
a comatose and blind existence
hatred holocaust, you see in me
is more than just a way of life
ive reinvented the way i relate to this complacent world

all of life decays
rapes my eyes
screams never silence the pain
death is like an old friend
i cant wait to watch you die

i am your vice, so real, so real
desires of the scars of new flesh
bathe in your blood, excites, excites
the ritualistic lacerations
inhumanities, profane, insane
inflicted since the dawn of time
make your peace with god, goodbye
and embrace the pain that burns inside you

all of life decays
rapes my eyes
screams never silence the pain
death is like an old friend
i cant wait to watch you die
i cant wait

come step inside my hate, you know theres nothing to it
step inside my pain, youll never make it through it
redefine your life in sado-paradise
necessary cleansing of the minds eye
love and agony. electric ecstasy
cant get enough, euphoric serenity
stains wont fade away, forever scarstruck
they never fade away, forever scarstruck

drown in my hate, you know, you know
brutalitys the way of this world
branded and scarred, defy, defy
a comatose and blind existence
youre like the walking dead, so blind inside
oblivious to psycho pleasure
i am your new god, un-god
so if you want hell, here i am

everything around me decays
rapes my eyes
screams never silence the pain
make you my canvas of pure, fresh flesh
scarstruck
scarstruck
scarstruck im the one that brings you war
infiltrate unguarded shores
master of afflicting pain
point is where all die


im the one to taste your blood
trashing through the crimson mud
messenger of all demise
point is where i reign
piercing, impaling, no judgement, just punishment
dis-create, annihilate assault with no regret

im the one to taste your death
basking in your dying breath
messenger of all demise
point is where all die

piercing, impaling, no judgement, just punishment
dis-create, annihilate assault with no regret

born to kill sweep and clear
taring down the face of fear
shrapnel flies dehumanize
flesh and blood will fertilize
empty all the magazines
lethal spray from m-16s
pace the march and sing the song
right the fuck where i belong

stained in blood
no fear - no sound
penetrate your holy ground
leave you where your comrades lie
point is where all die

pure destruction has begun
fearlessly the battles won
spread extinction through the dawn
signature of wrath is spawned
minister of death unleashed
my lust for war will never cease
with no remorse i watch you die
body counts the bottom line

crashing slashing to the end
your final pulse has just been spent
leave you where your comrades lie
point is where all fucking die


crashing slashing to the end
your final pulse has just been spent
leave you where your comrades lie
stained in blood
no fear, no pain, no life


clouded skies rain only death
silence all opposing threats
quench the hunger of my gun
exploding cites overrun
im the one to taste your death
basking in your dying breath
messenger of all demise
point is where all die well im searching through my bed
i got ankles in my head
im in really bad
its the best time i ever had

plus girls with big town hair
but why must i suffer
for being a fecal lover
im a shit boy
im a shit boy - there should be more i stalk close in from above
silent wings will test your faith
death will never hear me pass
launch attack youre too late
i hear flak inside my head
deafening thunder cities burn
carpet-bombing laid to waste
thrown inside a death mask

holy cross embedded in your tomb
casualties are buried through your mind
certain death is screaming from the sky

i live to destroy below
hunted victims are unseen
flying wrath a fortress hell
war machine to kill all
i leave carnage in my wake
choking bleeding for your life
faceless prey has been erased
silence reigns youre dead now

holy cross embedded in your tomb
casualties are buried through your mind
certain death is screaming from the sky


listen to the rhythm of a dead man walking
silent is the heartbeat of the predator stalking
hear the sound of air feel the warmth touch your neck
reality is not fair no time to second guess
hear the distant ringing of the blade as it cuts your neck
silent is the cry lying on your mattress of blood
an easy mark for a veteran of execution

i walk step by step with death
where all bludgeoned bodies lie
you will see my face of rage
cut your heart out of your chest
leave impaled the consummation of mankind what happened to you

and walk this land?
please take my hand no blood no glory

a demonstration
of domination
show of pure intimidation


full contact why i live and breathe
side stepping all the human debris
head strong i know that ill prevail
face down in my arena you will fail

head to head eye to eye
human pile of proven pride
ripping flesh spitting teeth
sacrifice for victory
base line goal line
overtime killing time

relentless brotherhood of discipline
centuries of tradition is to win
head first into battle feel the rush
living on adrenaline your try is crushed


no blood no glory
all pain and fury

head to head eye to eye
human pile of proven pride
ripping flesh spitting teeth
sacrifice for victory
base line goal line
overtime killing time forces united the choice is yours 
violent pacification

take a look into my mind
where pleasure is refined
endless burning holes
of scarred souls

theres nothing more intense
than mental misery that i dispense
so follow right along

drunk as fuck
searching for a open store
i think im out of luck

drunk drivers against mad mothers cataract blinding your eyes

just another lost casualty of the times
the wicked will feed the chaos
control and rule disorder
disintegrations multiplying

a future of never-ending
insane civil disorder
free yourself from the red dawn
the time has come
deaths head shattering
blow to the throat
at the end of the rope
degeneration that follows into the fire
in a world gone insane
no one else left to blame
youre just another part of the collective vile

the wicked will feed the chaos
control and rule disorder
disintegrations multiplying
til there is no more bloodline
a future of never-ending
insane civil disorder
free yourself from the red dawn
the time is now

era of total destruction has slowly begun
yielding death, none will survive
order out of chaos, the true will of the beast
a life of desolation

their time is now
era of total destruction will never desist
only death is your saviour
order out of chaos, the true will of the beast
a life of persecution
ten bleeding hearts

scourges preceding the end

sadomasochist a high profile, trained in apathy
intellect repulsed, your torn, and death will have a face
ravage passion, a theme for the 90s
tormented devients, when fucking becomes psychotic
domesticated rage, actions of desperation

drastic pain a symphony, sceams
no escape your time to die
hardened steel against your head, it weights
self-destruct remain insane
(repeat second verse)
death will have your face use the need, lose control
hidden voice inviting
imposing will, unconscious skill
embraced immoral passion
born is still, thirst for thrill
indulgence of illusion
neurotic, psychotic
dead silent screams, come alive
killing seed, first degree
i shut the world outside
denied and laid to waste
the body and soul divide
a final thrill, a timely kill
unbound, unguarded
fantasized, realized
enforced upon the dying
free reign of the asylum
archaic energy thrives
dead cold, i control
eternal screams that slowly die
killing spree, first degree
i shut the world outside
denied and laid to waste
the body and soul divide
dementia born of sin
a symptom that begins
vengeance so divine
lost my grip of whats real
unrestrained self-induced vertigo
manic power chills my spine
i cant erase this instinct i embrace
two faced moral abandon
races my blood boils my skin
unhinging the doorway to this asylum
releasing unshackled poison dreams
beginning the end of temptation
a vengeance so divine
the end of temptation
a vengeance so divine
killing spree, first degree
i shut the world outside
denied and laid to waste
the body and soul divide bombers in flight
trident missiles in the air
my missiles underground
protect us till were dead
memories of tomorrow (crying sorrow)
push the button
kiss good-bye the nuclear arsenal
a bomber flying off their ramps
nuclear bombs explode
radio active people
search for medicine
pray for shelter
kill for food
memories of tomorrow (crying sorrow)
mass starvation
contaminated water
destroyed cities
mutilated bodies
memories of tomorrow (crying sorrow)
ill kill myself
id rather die
if you could see in the future
youd know why
memories of tomorrow get your motor running
head out on the highway
looking for adventure
and whatever comes our way
ya darling you could make it happen
leave the world in a dull disgrace
fire all of your guns and once in
explode into space

heavy metal thunder
racing with the wind
and the feeling that im under

to do such things like this
to take the sweet that you dont know

your bodys looking ill

so drop the acid pill, dont stop to think now

youre having a good time, baby, but that wont last
your minds all full of things, youre living too fast

price of life is high!
now, youre gonna die! come hear the moon is calling
the witching hour draws near
come hear the bell is tolling
mortals run in fear
prepare the altar now and hear the virgin cry
hold fast the sacrafice
for now its the time to die
all hell breaks loose
hells breaking loose
unveil the pentagram
and feel the demons lust
come watch the holy men
who look on in disgust
come taste blood
and feel the heat of satans breath
look in the skys and see
the warriors of death
all hell breaks loose
hells breaking loose
witching hour
our work is now complete
the blood runs fast and free
and satan takes his bride
and crys of blasphemy
all hell rejoices at the child
that she will bear
and satans only son
shall be the worlds despair
all hell breaks loose
hells breaking loose
witching hour razors edge
outlines the dead
incisions in my head
anticipation the stimulation
to kill the exhilaration

close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die

close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane

innate seed
to watch you bleed
a demanding physical need
desecrated eviscerated
times perpetuated


close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die

close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane

inert flesh
a bloody tomb
a decorated splatter brightens the room
an execution a sadist ritual
mad intervals of mind residuals

close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die


close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane arrogance, violence, world in disarray
dealing with insanity every fuckin’ day
i hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fuckin’ scene
pissing match of egos, fuck your vanity
ain’t got the time, i don’t want anything from you
feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin’ do
no looking back, no regrets, no apologies
what you get is what you see

live fast, on high
repentless, let it ride

my songs relive the atrocities of war
can’t take society any fuckin’ more
intensity, anarchy, hatred amplified
playing this shit is all that keeps me alive
i leave it all on the road living on the stage
this is my life where i kill it everyday
so take you shot, bottom’s up, this is no lie
i’ll be beating this guitar ’til the day i die

live fast, on high
repentless, let it ride

live fast, on high
repentless, let it ride you go to the church, you kiss the cross
you will be saved at any cost
you have your own reality
christianity
you spend your life just kissing ass
a trait thats grown as time has passed
you think the world will end today
you praise the lord, thats all you say
jesus saves
listen to you pray
you think youll see the pearly gates when death takes you away
for all respect, you cannot lust
in an invisible man you place your trust
indirect dependency
eternal attempt at amnesty
he will decide who lives and dies
depopulate, satanic rise
you will be an accessory
irreverence and blasphemy
jesus saves
no need to pray, the gates of pearl have turned to gold
it seems youve lost your way


jesus saves
no words of praise, no promised land to take you to
there is no other way blasting our way through the boundaries of hell
no one can stop us tonight
we take on the world with hatred inside
mayhem the reason we fight
surviving the slaughters and killing weve lost
then we return from the dead
attacking once more now with twice as much strength
we conquer then move on ahead

evil
my words defy
evil
has no disguise
evil
will take your soul
evil
my wrath unfolds

satan our master in evil mayhem
guides us with every first step

i am the antichrist
its what i was meant to be
your god left me behind
and set my soul to be free

watching disciples
of the satanic rule
pentagram of blood
holds the jackals truth
searching for the answer
christ hasnt come
awaiting the final moment
the birth of satans son


screams
from a life i live
torment
is what i give
torture
is what i love
the downfall
of heavens above

i am the antichrist
all love is lost
insanity is what i am
eternally my soul will rot (rot... rot) existing on damnations edge
the priest had never known
to witness such a violent show
of power overthrown
angels fighting aimlessly
still dying by the sword
our legions killing all in sight
to get the one called lord
the gates of hell lie waiting as you see
theres no price to pay, just follow me
i can take your lost soul from the grave
jesus knows your soul can not be saved
crucify your so-called "lord"
he soon shall fall to me
your souls are damned, your god has fell
to slave for me eternally
hell awaits...
the reaper guards the darkened gates
that satan calls his home
demons feed the furnace where
the dead are free to roam


lonely children of the night
theres seven ways to go
each leading to the burning hole
that lucifer controls
priests of hades seek the sacred star
satan sees the answer lies not far
zombies screaming souls cry out to you
satanic laws prevail your life is through
pray to the moon... when it is round
death with you shall then abound
what you seek for cant be found
in sea or sky or underground

now i have you deep inside my everlasting grasp
the seven bloody gates of hell
is where youll live your last
warriors from hells domain
will bring you to your death
the flames of hades burning strong
your soul shall never rest


the gates of hell lie waiting as you see
theres no price to pay just follow me
i can take your lost soul from the grave
jesus knows your soul can not be saved
sacrifice the lives of all
i know they soon shall die
their souls are damned to rot in hell
and keep the fires growing deep inside
hell awaits... live by the sword and help to contain
the helpless minds of you all
die by my hand in pools of blood
clutch yourself as you fall
mindless tyranny, forgotten victims
children slaughtered in vain
raping the maids, in which they serve
only the words of the lord

die by the sword
die by the sword

satan watches all of us
smiles as some do his bidding
try to escape the grasp of my hand
and your life will no longer exist
hear our cry, save us from
the hell in which we live
we turn our heads toward the sky
and listen for the steel

die by the sword
die by the sword


watch as flowers decay
on the cryptic life that died
the wisdom of the wizards
is only a nurtured lie
black knights of hells domain
walk upon the dead
satanas sits upon
the blood on which he feeds

die by the sword
die by the sword drones since the dawn of time
compelled to live your sheltered lives
not once has anyone ever seen
such a rise of pure hypocrisy
ill instigate ill free your mind
ill show you what ive known all this time
god hates us all, god hates us all
you know its true god hates this place
you know its true he hates this race
homicide-suicide
hate heals, you should try it sometime
strive for peace with acts of war
the beauty of death we all adore
i have no faith distracting me
i know why your prayers will never be answered
god hates us all; god hates us all
he fuckin hates me
pessimist, terrorist targeting the next mark
global chaos feeding on hysteria
cut throat, slit your wrist, shoot you in the back fair game
drug abuse, self abuse searching for the next high
sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time
im waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies
i never said i wanted to be gods disciple
ill never be the one to blindly follow
man made virus infecting the world
self-destruct human time bomb
what if there is no god would you think the fuckin same
wasting your life in a leap of blind faith
wake the fuck up cant ignore what i say
i got my own philosophy
i hate everyone equally
you cant tear that out of me
no segregation -separation
just me in my world of enemies
i never said i wanted to be gods disciple
ill never be the one to blindly follow
ill never be the one to bear the cross-disciple
i reject this fuckin race
i despise this fuckin place how ive waited for you to come
ive been here all alone
now that youve arrived
please stay awhile
and i promise i wont keep you long
ill keep you forever...forever...forever...

graze the skin with my fingertips
the brush of dead cold flesh appease the means
provoking images delicate features so smooth
a pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon

dance with the dead in my dreams
listen to their hallowed screams
the dead have taken my soul
temptations lost all control

simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
lose all mind control, rationale declines
empty eyes enslave the creations
of placid faces and lifeless pageants!


in the depths of a mind insane
fantasy and reality are the same!


graze the skin with my fingertips
the brush of dead warm flesh pacifies the means
incised members ornaments on my being
adulating the skin before me

simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
lose all mind control, rationale declines
empty eyes enslave the creations
of placid faces and lifeless pageants!

dance with the dead in my dreams
listen to their hallowed screams
the dead have taken my soul
temptations lost all control
dance with the dead in my dreams

drink flesh, life itself
prepare to reign a thousand years funeral held for the depression of man
holds the key to his own death
entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
tighten the tourniquet around your neck
sifting away the debris of hated life
cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
seeking life beyond your perishment
repeating words echoing through your mind
chanting lines of blind witchery
to save yourself from extinction
wanting to die is your reason to live
new life born from the oppressed
taste your blood as it trickles through the air
another casualty beyond the shadows you fall
losing ground, the fate you feel draws near
fatality, reality, await the final call

my sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity
vessels in my brain carrying death until my birth
come and die with me forever, share insanity
do you wanna die?!
the waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies
turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind
non-rising body from the grave showing new reality
what i am, what i want, i’m only after death follow me, ill lead the way, your fears will soon overtake
hide your infinite tears inside, it seeks your smallest break
screaming as if nothing helps, you press on to survive
playing out the fantasies of a force that keeps you alive

ill have you down on your knees
youll play my fatal game
ill satisfy your every need
youll never be the same
take my hand, ill show you how youve just one life to live
the road youre on goes straight to hell, your life is yours to give

this world youre living is so unreal, perfected just for me

ill have you down on your knees

auschwitz, the meaning of pain
the way that i want you to die
slow death, immense decay
showers that cleanse you of your life
forced in like cattle
you run
stripped of
your lifes worth
human mice, for the angel of death
four hundred thousand more to die

angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead

sadistic, surgeon of demise
sadist of the noblest blood
destroying, without mercy
to benefit the aryan race
surgery, with no anesthesia
feel the knife pierce you intensely
inferior, no use to mankind
strapped down screaming out to die

angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead
infamous butcher
angel of death

pumped with fluid, inside your brain
pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
burning flesh drips away
test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
frigid cold cracks your limbs
how long can you last
in this frozen water burial?
sewn together, joining heads
just a matter of time
til you rip yourselves apart
millions laid out in their
crowded tombs
sickening ways to achieve
the holocaust

seas of blood, bury life
smell your death as it burns
deep inside of you
abacinate, eyes that bleed
praying for the end of
your wide awake nightmare
wings of pain, reach out for you
his face of death staring down
your blood running cold
injecting cells, dying eyes
feeding on the screams of
the mutants hes creating
pathetic harmless victims
left to die
rancid angel of death
flying free


angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead
infamous butcher
angel of death
angel of death harlots of hell spread your wings
as i penetrate your soul
feel the fire shoot through your body
as i slip into your throne

i care not how you plead
satans child now stalks the earth
born from my demon seed

hot wings of hell
burns in my wake
death is what you pray
behold captor of sin

infernal slaves of manipulation
captive of my vice
abandon god the helpless one
to relieve you of your plight
subversive action will not help
it will strengthen me
i see decline your every move
death your final plea


hot wings of hell
burns in my wake
death is what you pray
behold captor of sin

your skin turns to leather
i ignite your timid blood
you feel my lethal touch
as i grasp your weary soul
ill take you down into the fire

harlots of hell spread your wings

can damage the mind
shattering the skull, shredding the brain
severing the spine
bury a round of lead in the chest
its quite an impression
imagine the innards of your soul
the infliction
instinctive regression
with intent to kill
no regard of human life
or the blood spilled
riddled convulsions
confetti of flesh
scattered helplessly
losing your control of physical facilities
release the slide to cleanse inside
prepare to anoint
snap the tongue in the groove discharge
to make my hallowed point
instinctive regression
with intent to kill
no regard of human life
or the blood spilled
power of a gun
used with conviction
dispersed on excursions
randomly kills its victims
my sweet revenge
bitter in depression
the thrilling release
of a hatred deep persuasion
power of a gun
used with conviction
diffused compulsions
unending repercussions
violent emotion
screaming revulsion
spasmic convulsions
death an empty gun i had you back, but its no use
false accusations are on the loose
you know what? it makes no sense that you tied your own noose
you never felt the sores decay
your perfect world is ending today
so what? i wouldnt have it any other way


is this your paradise? you think you thought this through?
cause when you rolled the dice, the house came down on you
dont care what you do or say, your suicide begins today
have fun in paradise, this hell is just for you

you against you
shitty time to make a stand all without a master plan, just you
you against you

so hows your paradise? hindsight just laughs at you
with conflict comes a price, that price weighs heaviest on you
i guess i should say thanks, dissension in the ranks
you panic lit the fuel; now its you against you

you against you
wasnt looking for a fight, but im showing up tonight
shitty time to make a stand all without a master plan, just you
you against you


the seeds are what youve sown
never should have lit that fuse
enjoy your paradise
this hell is just for you how ive waited for you to come
ive been here all alone
now that youve arrived
please stay awhile
and i promise i wont keep you long
ill keep you forever...forever...forever...

graze the skin with my fingertips
the brush of dead cold flesh appease the means
provoking images delicate features so smooth
a pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon

dance with the dead in my dreams
listen to their hallowed screams
the dead have taken my soul
temptations lost all control

simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
lose all mind control, rationale declines
empty eyes enslave the creations
of placid faces and lifeless pageants!
in the depths of a mind insane
fantasy and reality are the same!


graze the skin with my fingertips
the brush of dead warm flesh pacifies the means
incised members ornaments on my being
adulating the skin before me

simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
lose all mind control, rationale declines
empty eyes enslave the creations

dance with the dead in my dreams
listen to their hallowed screams
the dead have taken my soul

hello?
hello mr. gein?

i dont wanna play anymore mr. gein
mr. gein this isnt fun anymore i dont wanna play anymore mr. gein
mr. gein?
i want out of here mr. gein!
let me out now! mortuaries, dead of night
my body starts to rise
in my mind the horror lives
to feel death deep inside
relentless lust of rotting flesh
to thrash the tomb she lies
heathen whore of satans wrath
i spit at your demise
virgin child now drained of life
your soul cannot be free
not given the chance to rot in hell
satans cross points to hell
the earth i must uncover
a passion grows to feast upon
the frozen blood inside her
i feel the urge the growing need
to fuck this sinful corpse
my tasks complete, the bitchs soul
lies raped in demonic lust



her stomach bursts the casket breaks
the seed has taken form
a writhing shape of twisted flesh
the devils child is thrown
hungry for the smell of death
he rules forbidden evil
vengeance with a frenzied hatred
the bastard now must die
lost souls of the dead
form legions that burst through hells gates
death of one sacrifice
to avenge the raped corpse from the grave
blood of one mortal man
the fire grows stronger within
fate of a frenzied lust
lucifer takes my dark soul
down to the fiery pits of hell
(down to the fiery pits of hell) when war cries echoing all begin
never know any other way to fight, just win
blood of the enemy when penance is due
you know that sacrifice starts with you!

cast the first stone
stand in my way
its vengeance you owe
with blood, you will pay!

i live for battle the intensity knows no peer
your defiance will prove severe
choking on blood, beaten in pain
realizing the fighting is all in vain

cast the first stone
stand in my way
its vengeance you owe
with blood, you will pay!
when war cries echo sacrifice is you!


can feel that sweeping everywhere i walk?
like a devastating fire every time i talk!
man infested component you cant stop
a block of granite on my shoulder you cant knock off!

cast the first stone
stand in my way
its vengeance you owe
with blood, you will pay! through the night we rise in pairs
lords at night we ride
from the depths of hells domain
reborn to reign this night
roam throughout the endless wars
hold high his name we must
warriors from the gates of hell
in lord satan we trust

stalking the night, cant you feel im near
watching each step that you take
i take lives and show all no mercy this night
attack those not knowing their fate

brothers of the prince of night
by bargains we have made
allies with the darkened souls
our legions we must save
fight for our eternal quest
god cant save you in time
evil stalks the night with us
your soul, it shall be mine


stalking the night, cant you feel im near
watching each step that you take
i take lives and show all no mercy this night
attack those not knowing my force

i am the menace in your eyes
the one you cant escape
your life falls in my grasp
you know your end is near
you pray your god will help
his strength no match for mine
your last hope slips away
thy soul begins to bleed
i tear your flesh to shreds
burn holes throughout your mind
your eyes now filled with blood
a victim of my force
in endless agony
you realize your defeat
recite my masters chants
your soul now his to keep


stalking the night, cant you feel im near
watching each step that you take
i take lives and show all no mercy this night
attack those not knowing their fate frantic minds are terrified
life lies in a grave
silent death rides high above
on the wings of revelation
multi-death from chemicals
arrogance has won
annihilation must be swift
destroy without destruction

gods of the throne must be watching from hell
awaiting the mass genocide
soldiers defeated by death from a smell
bodies lie dormant no life
rising new souls on the land where they fell
demons not ready to die
nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie
chemical warfare
artificial fucking peace
line up in a death row
generals in their slow defeat
diminish from this hell
banished from the dying world
the lords of hell await
dogs of war are helpless prey
to immortality



liquidate
the torture kills the troops that try to fight
terminate
human pesticide bring days of doom
mist falls
the deadly gas that brings them to their knees
sacrifice
steal the soul and send his corpse to hell
mummified regions lying in dust
fall victim to this game
petrified corpses bathing in rust
taken without being blamed
falsified spirits farther they fall
soon they will join us in hell
see the sky burning the gates are ablaze
satan waits eager to merge propaganda death ensemble, burial to be
corpses rotting through the night, in blood laced misery
scorched earth the policy, the reason for the siege
the pendulum it shaves the blade, the strafing air blood raid

infiltration push reserves, encircle the front lines
supreme art of strategy, playing on the minds
bombard till submission, take all to their graves

fall into me, the skys crimson tears
abolish the rules made of stone

pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above

awaiting the hour of reprisal
your time slips away


raining blood
from a lacerated sky
bleeding its horror
creating my structure
now i shall reign in blood an unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
unsuspecting victims no warnings no signs
judgment day the second coming arrives
before you see the light you must die

forgotten children conform a new faith
avidity and lust controlled by hate
the never ending search for your shattered sanity
souls of damnation in their own reality

bodies lay lifeless like dolls
a moment that felt like days
lives extinguished in a rage
so nauseous i dont realize
incessantly feeding the flies
in the moment of visceral haze
the last thing you see are my crazed eyes
the last thing you see are my eyes
fear lies beneath your facade
in panic you scream for your god
no way i’ll ever abstain
blood falls from the ceiling like rain
patiently unleash my violence
ingesting the sweet sound of your silence
in darkness this feeling i love
to be covered in blood... blood from above
this violence finally sets me free
brings demons back to torture me
theres no god pulling at my strings
im above all sorrow faith can bring
disengaged i see your face
an adrenaline rush i can’t replace
hands around your neck
your senses numb
staring into your eyes when the stillness comes razors edge
outlines the dead
incisions in my head
anticipation the stimulation
to kill the exhilaration

close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die

close your eyes

close your eyes

step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane waiting the hour destined to die
here on the table of hell
a figure in white unknown by man
approaching the altar of death
high priest awaiting dagger in hand
spilling the pure virgin blood
satans slaughter, ceremonial death
answer his every command
death will come easy just close your eyes
dream of the friends youll see
heavenly failure losing again
move on to a new form of life
altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned
confronting the evil you dread
coalesce into one your shadow and soul
soon you will meet the undead
altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned
confronting the evil you dread
coalesce into one your shadow and soul
soon you will meet the undead
enter to the realm of satan!


blood turning black, the change has begun
feeling the hatred of all damned in hell
flesh starts to burn, twist and deform
eyes dripping blood realization of death
transforming of five toes to two
learn the sacred words of praise, hail satan
a gift of powers disposed upon you
use them when you feel the need
master the forces and powers of satan
controlling the creatures instinct
drawn to the castles that float in the sky
learn to resist the temptation
watching the angels sift through the heavens

lost child pay the dead
bleeding screams of silence
in my veins, your eternity

ill kill you and your dreams tonight
begin new life
bleed your death upon me
let your bloodline feed my youth

first breath born come alive learn to kill
bloodfest awaits to feed your hunger
dark side has no rival test your faith in blood
night hides the hunting packs a feeding frenzy

ill kill you and your dreams tonight
begin new life
bleed your death upon me
let your bloodline feed my youth


i am the first, not the last
condemned by a single kiss
betrayed eternally
ill rip inside your soul
contaminating the world
defying god and son
black heart that brings your death
living in infamy
drink the flesh of life itself
prepare to reign a thousand years

ill kill you and your dreams tonight
begin new life
bleed your death upon me
let your bloodline feed my youth

bleed your death upon me
bleed your death upon me
bleed your death upon me
let your bloodline feed my youth
blame god chosen children
as you die im immortal
faithless no religion
stalking prey is my confession
captive blood enslavement
pain and hunger drives your madness
drink flesh, life itself
prepare to reign a thousand years murder at your every foot step
a childs toy sudden death
sniper blazes you through your knees
falling down can you feel the heat
burn!
ambushed by the spray of lead
count the bullet holes in your head
offspring sent out to cry
living mandatory suicide

holes burn deep in your chest
raked by machine gun fire
screaming soul sent out to die
living mandatory suicide

lying, dying, screaming in pain
begging, pleading, bullets drop like rain
mines explode, pain sheers through your brain
radical amputation, this is insane


fly swatter stakes drive through your chest
spikes impale you as youre forced off the crest
soldier of misfortune
hunting with bated breath
a vile smell, like tasting death
dead bodies, dying and wounded
litter the city streets
shattered glass, bits of clothing and human deceit
dying in terror
bloods cheap, its everywhere
mandatory suicide, massacre on the front line i stab you right between the eyes
you awaken from the lies
i said it ever since the inception
where the masters of deception
im a godless heretic
not a god-fearing lunatic
thats why its become my obsession
to treat god like an infection
my scars insane, my life profane
i deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!
like a storm that devastates
religious doubt i instigate
take a listen to my confession
there is no filter on my aggression
with a blister open wide
to keep the massacre alive
i got cold devastation
with my moral imperfection
my scars insane, my life profane
i deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!
religious death, i instigate
from what the bible demonstrates
does it document creation
of this hopeless infliction
of a godless heretic
not a god-fearing lunatic
thats why its become my obsession
to treat god like an infection
my scars insane, my life profane
i deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!
open life scars, crushing open wounds
the walls of this scene will be crashing at you
you left senseless mentally unfit
never fucking heard from you again
never fucking heard from again trapped in purgatory
a lifeless object, alive
awaiting reprisal
death will be their acquittance

the sky is turning red

home turf my battlefield

stray bullets can kill

expendable youths
fighting for possession
having control the principle obsession
rivalry and retribution
death the only solution
injured soul on the hard ground
head blown off face down
lying in a pool of blood
an accidental death homicide

struggling to survive
the drug induced warfare
to have control and principle obsession
expendable youth fighting for possession
violence is only a friend aaah!!

raked by machine gun fire
screaming soul sent out to die
living mandatory suicide
suicide
suicide
suicide
suicide

lying, dying, screaming in pain
begging, pleading, bullets drop like rain
mines explode, pain sheers through your brain
radical amputation, this is insane
fly swatter stakes drive through your chest
spikes impale you as youre forced off the crest
soldier of misfortune
hunting with bated breath
a vile smell, like tasting death
dead bodies, dying and wounded
litter the city streets
shattered glass, bits of clothing and human deceit
dying in terror
bloods cheap, its everywhere
mandatory suicide, massacre on the front line trapped in purgatory
a lifeless object, alive
awaiting reprisal
death will be their acquittance

the sky is turning red
return to power draws near
fall into me, the skys crimson tears
abolish the rules made of stone

pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above

awaiting the hour of reprisal
your time slips away


raining blood
from a lacerated sky
bleeding its horror
creating my structure
now i shall reign in blood welcome to my world
involve yourself within my dream
experience a life
just like your mind thought not to be
take a look through time
as past or present words to be
i rule this inferno
enthroned for eternity

coils of the serpent unwind
buried beneath you will find
deep in the halls of the damned
spirit in black till the end
spirits damned to rot
amidst the brimstone fireballs
eyes of the dead
watching from their living walls
broken glass reflections
show your flesh eaten away
beyond the gates ill take you
where the blood forever rains



afterlife confessions
tell me who you used to be
looking on in wonder
as i show you it was me
burning from within
you know one spark is all it takes
hear the piercing cries of all
who found that hell awaits
living nightmare cant you see
you really have no choice
faded memories haunt you
listen closely to my voice
feed me all your hatred
empty all your thoughts to me
i can fill your emptiness
with immortality
welcome to my world
involve yourself within my dream
experience a life just like your mind thought not to be
take a look through time
as past or present words to be
i rule this inferno
enthroned for eternity peaceful confrontation meet war machine
seizing all civil liberties
honest ballotation among banshee
spilling blood on humanity

you cannot hide the face of death
oppression ruled by bloodshed
no disguise can deface evil
the massacre of innocent people

deviated lies fear blinds your eyes
enforcing their truth through a gun
aggressive discipline and barbaric control
thousands of people cannot be wrong

you cannot hide the face of death
oppression ruled by bloodshed
no disguise can deface evil
stains the primitive sickle
blood red


growing opposition with words as ammunition
expressions of lifes liberties
aggressive discipline and barbaric control
spilling blood throughout humanity

you cannot hide the face of death
oppression ruled by bloodshed
no disguise can deface evil
stains the primitive sickle
blood red join in my quest to leave life overturned
spanning the world wave of doom
spewing out death with the evil ive churned
awaken the dead from their tombs
love turns to lust, the sensations ive felt
exploring the pleasures of sin
making the best of the cards ive been dealt
adjusting the odds so i win
unleash all my burning wrath
potential killing machine
take down all who block my path
enjoying all thats obscene, born of fire

prince of all darkness initiation
ritually baptised in flames
next to the throne, my abomination
spread terror throughout my domain
master the art that controls the impure
inherit the infamous keys
thousands of centuries i will endure
tyrant of all prophecies
some have called me satans son
a name i cannot deny
wielding fury thats second to none
far too vile to confine, born of fire

all things dead must rise again
when twilights blanket falls
splattered red, youll find my den
blood dripping from the walls
dreams born of desire
shaped, forged within the fire
twisted, warped, deranged i see
the worlds corrupt insanity

dreams possess nightmarish figures
burning, cant escape the embers
lost are those who trust the liar
satans son, im born of fire harlots of hell spread your wings
as i penetrate your soul
feel the fire shoot through your body
as i slip into your throne
cast aside, do as you will
i care not how you plead
satans child now stalks the earth
born from my demon seed

hot wings of hell
burns in my wake
death is what you pray
behold captor of sin

infernal slaves of manipulation
captive of my vice
abandon god the helpless one
to relieve you of your plight
subversive action will not help
it will strengthen me
i see decline your every move
death your final plea


hot wings of hell
burns in my wake
death is what you pray
behold captor of sin

your skin turns to leather
i ignite your timid blood
you feel my lethal touch
as i grasp your weary soul
ill take you down into the fire

harlots of hell spread your wings
as i penetrate your soul
feel the fire shoot through your body
as i slip into your throne
cast aside, do as you will
i care not how you plead
satans child now stalks the earth
born from my demon seed

hot wings of hell
burns in my wake
death is what you pray
behold captor of sin live by the sword and help to contain
the helpless minds of you all
die by my hand in pools of blood
clutch yourself as you fall
mindless tyranny, forgotten victims
children slaughtered in vain
raping the maids, in which they serve
only the words of the lord

die by the sword
die by the sword

satan watches all of us
smiles as some do his bidding
try to escape the grasp of my hand
and your life will no longer exist
hear our cry, save us from
the hell in which we live
we turn our heads toward the sky
and listen for the steel

die by the sword
die by the sword


watch as flowers decay
on the cryptic life that died
the wisdom of the wizards
is only a nurtured lie
black knights of hells domain
walk upon the dead
satanas sits upon
the blood on which he feeds

die by the sword
die by the sword unknown are the caverns of the mind
new realms of affliction lurk inside
unbound massive mental energy
your last breaths taken from you easily
incoherence disrupts your rationale
involuntary your last confessional
no sense of being missing segments of time
inconsistency is feeding on your mind

mind control, pain unfolds
i own all your sensations
weakening, reasoning
mesmeric full demolition
hypnotized - victimized
behold the threshold to the web
screaming souls fear echoes
piercing boundaries of the dead

penetration of the window to your soul
deterioration of the mind, no self control
temporarily comprehend no memories
hollow carcass of a man is all i leave


execution but a thought in the end
slowly erasing your life and what has been
passing victims in the land of secrecy
cerebral death can come to you in your dreams an unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
unsuspecting victims no warnings no signs
judgment day the second coming arrives
before you see the light you must die

forgotten children conform a new faith
avidity and lust controlled by hate
the never ending search for your shattered sanity
souls of damnation in their own reality

chaos rampant
an age of distrust
confrontations
impulsive habitat

bastard sons begat your cunting daughters
promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers
ingrate souls condemned for all eternity
obtained by immoral observance a domineering deity

chaos rampant
an age of distrust
confrontations
impulsive sabbath


on and on south of heaven
on and on south of heaven
on and on south of heaven
on and on south of heaven
(lead - king)

the root of all evil is the heart of a black soul
a force that has lived all eternity
the never ending search for a truth never told
the loss of all hope and your dignity

chaos rampant
an age of distrust
confrontations
impulsive habitat

on and on south of heaven
on and on south of heaven
on and on south of heaven
on and on south of heaven


(lead - hanneman) funeral held for the depression of man
holds the key to his own death
entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
tighten the tourniquet around your neck
sifting away the debris of hated life
cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
seeking life beyond your perishment
repeating words echoing through your mind
chanting lines of blind witchery
to save yourself from extinction
wanting to die is your reason to live
new life born from the oppressed
taste your blood as it trickles through the air
another casualty beyond the shadows you fall
losing ground, the fate you feel draws near
fatality, reality, await the final call

my sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity
vessels in my brain carrying death until my birth
come and die with me forever, share insanity


do you wanna die?!
the waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies
turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind
non-rising body from the grave showing new reality
what i am, what i want, i’m only after death aaah!!

auschwitz, the meaning of pain
the way that i want you to die
slow death, immense decay
showers that cleanse you of your life
forced in like cattle
you run
stripped of
your lifes worth
human mice, for the angel of death
four hundred thousand more to die

angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead

sadistic, surgeon of demise
sadist of the noblest blood
destroying, without mercy
to benefit the aryan race
surgery, with no anesthesia
feel the knife pierce you intensely
inferior, no use to mankind
strapped down screaming out to die

angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead
infamous butcher
angel of death

pumped with fluid, inside your brain
pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
burning flesh drips away
test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
frigid cold cracks your limbs
how long can you last
in this frozen water burial?
sewn together, joining heads
just a matter of time
til you rip yourselves apart
millions laid out in their
crowded tombs
sickening ways to achieve
the holocaust

seas of blood, bury life
smell your death as it burns
deep inside of you
abacinate, eyes that bleed
praying for the end of
your wide awake nightmare
wings of pain, reach out for you
his face of death staring down
your blood running cold
injecting cells, dying eyes
feeding on the screams of
the mutants hes creating
pathetic harmless victims
left to die
rancid angel of death
flying free


angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead
infamous butcher
angel of death
angel of death join in my quest to leave life overturned

satans son, im born of fire cursed black magic night
weve been struck down
down in this hell
spells surround me day and night
stricken by the force of evil light
the force of evil light
cast under his spell
blinding my eyes
twisting my mind
fight to resist the evil inside
captive of a force of satans might
a force of satans might
fighting the curse
break it, i must
laughing in sorrow
crying in lust

my strength slips fast, soon i must fall
victim of fortune, my sources grow small
life slips away as demons come forth
death takes my hand and captures my soul this fucking countrys lost its grip
sub-conscious hold begins to slip
the scales of justice begin to tip
the legal system has no spine
its corroding from inside
slap your hand and youll do no time
reality on vacation
all across a blinded nation
mentally under sedation
anyone can be set free
on a technicality
explain the law again to me
here in 1994
things are different than before
violence is what we adore
invitation to the game
guns and blades and media fame
every day more of the same
murder, mayhem, anarchy
now are all done legally
mastermind your killing spree


unafraid of punishment
with a passive government
theres nothing for you to regret
nothing to regret
unimposing policy
no enforcing ministry
gaping with judicial flaws
watch a fading nation crawl
clashing with the publics frame
im the one thats place in fame
legislature sets the stage
social slaves caught in my rage
administrative anarchy theres nothing
you can do to me
the world around you is drifting to a
continental tomb you see
violence is my passion
i will never be contained
living with aggression and its
everlasting reign
