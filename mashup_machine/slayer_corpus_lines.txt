[intro]
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah

[verse 1]
auschwitz, the meaning of pain
the way that i want you to die
slow death, immense decay
showers that cleanse you of your life
forced in like cattle
you run
stripped of
your life's worth
human mice, for the angel of death
four hundred thousand more to die

[chorus 1]
angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead

[verse 2]
sadistic, surgeon of demise
sadist of the noblest blood
destroying, without mercy
to benefit the aryan race
surgery, with no anesthesia
feel the knife pierce you intensely
inferior, no use to mankind
strapped down, screaming out to die

[chorus 2]
angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead
infamous butcher
angel of death

[verse 3]
pumped with fluid, inside your brain
pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
burning flesh drips away
test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
frigid cold cracks your limbs
how long can you last
in this frozen water burial?
sewn together, joining heads
just a matter of time
'till you rip yourselves apart
millions laid out in their
crowded tombs
sickening ways to achieve
the holocaust

[verse 4]
seas of blood, bury life
smell your death as it burns
deep inside of you
abacinate, eyes that bleed
praying for the end of
your wide awake nightmare
wings of pain, reach out for you
his face of death staring down
your blood's running cold
injecting cells, dying eyes
feeding on the screams of
the mutants he's creating
pathetic harmless victims
left to die
rancid angel of death
flying free

[lead - king and hanneman]

[chorus 2]
angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead
infamous butcher
angel of death
angel of death [produced by rick rubin]
[instrumental intro]

[verse]
trapped in purgatory
a lifeless object, alive
awaiting reprisal
death will be their acquittance
the sky is turning red
return to power draws near
fall into me, the sky's crimson tears
abolish the rules made of stone

[bridge 1]
pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above

[bridge 2]
awaiting the hour of reprisal
your time slips away

[bridge 3]
raining blood
from a lacerated sky
bleeding its horror
creating my structure
now, i shall reign in blood

[instrumental outro]
[lead - king] [intro]
how i've waited for you to come
i've been here all alone
now that you've arrived
please stay awhile
and i promise i won't keep you long
i'll keep you forever (forever, forever, forever)

[verse 1]
graze the skin with my fingertips
the brush of dead, cold flesh appease the means
provoking images, delicate features so smooth
a pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon

[chorus]
dance with the dead in my dreams
listen to their hallowed screams
the dead have taken my soul
temptation's lost all control

[verse 2]
simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
lose all mind control, rationale declines
empty eyes enslave the creations
of placid faces and lifeless pageants

[bridge]
in the depths of a mind insane
fantasy and reality are the same

[lead - king and hanneman]

[verse 3]
graze the skin with my fingertips
the brush of dead, warm flesh pacifies the means
incised members ornaments on my being
adulating the skin before me

[verse 2]
simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
lose all mind control, rationale declines
empty eyes enslave the creations
of placid faces and lifeless pageants

[chorus]
dance with the dead in my dreams (hello? hello, mr. gein?)
listen to their hallowed screams (mr. gein?)
the dead have taken my soul (let me out of here, mr. gein)
temptation's lost all control (mr. gein? i don't want to play anymore, mr. gein)
dance with the dead in my dreams (mr. gein, this isn't fun anymore)
listen to their hallowed screams (i don't wanna play anymore, mr. gein)
the dead have taken my soul (mr. gein? i want out of here, mr. gein)
temptation's lost all control (let me out now) [intro]
an unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
unsuspecting victims, no warnings, no signs
judgment day, the second coming arrives
before you see the light, you must die

[verse 1]
forgotten children conform a new faith
avidity and lust controlled by hate
the never ending search for your shattered sanity
souls of damnation in their own reality

[pre-chorus 1]
chaos rampant
an age of distrust
confrontations
impulsive habitat

[verse 2]
bastard sons begat your cunting daughters
promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers
ingrate souls condemned for all eternity
obtained by immoral observance a domineering deity

[pre-chorus 2]
chaos rampant
an age of distrust
confrontations
impulsive sabbath

[chorus]
on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven

[lead - king]

[verse 3]
the root of all evil is the heart of a black soul
a force that has lived all eternity
the never ending search for a truth never told
the loss of all hope and your dignity

[pre-chorus 1]
chaos rampant
an age of distrust
confrontations
impulsive habitat

[chorus]
on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven
on and on, south of heaven

[lead - hanneman] [intro]
aaaaaaahhhhh

[lead - hanneman]

[verse 1]
blasting our way through the boundaries of hell
no one can stop us tonight
we take on the world with hatred inside
mayhem, the reason we fight
surviving the slaughters and killing we've lost
then we return from the dead
attacking once more now with twice as much strength
we conquer, then move on ahead

[chorus]
evil
my words defy
evil
has no disguise
evil
will take your soul
evil
my wrath unfolds

[lead - king]

[verse 2]
satan, our master in evil mayhem
guides us with every first step
our axes are growing with power and fury
soon there'll be nothing else left
midnight has come and the leathers strapped on
evil is at our command
we clash with god's angels and conquer new souls
consuming all that we can

[chorus]
evil
aah, haha
evil
has no disguise
evil
will take your soul
evil
my wrath unfolds

[lead - king and hanneman] [verse 1]
razor's edge
outlines the dead
incisions in my head
anticipation the stimulation
to kill the exhilaration

[chorus]
close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane

[verse 2]
innate seed
to watch you bleed
a demanding physical need
desecrated, eviscerated
time's perpetuated

[chorus]
close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane

[lead - king and hanneman]

[verse 3]
inert flesh
a bloody tomb
a decorated splatter brightens the room
an execution, a sadist ritual
mad intervals of mind residuals

[chorus]
close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane [verse 1]
arrogance, violence, world in disarray
dealing with insanity every fuckin’ day
i hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fuckin’ scene
pissing match of egos, fuck your vanity
ain’t got the time, i don’t want anything from you
feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin’ do
no looking back, no regrets, no apologies
what you get is what you see

[hook]
live fast, on high
repentless, let it ride

[verse 2]
my songs relive the atrocities of war
can’t take society any fuckin’ more
intensity, anarchy, hatred amplified
playing this shit is all that keeps me alive
i leave it all on the road living on the stage
this is my life where i kill it everyday
so take you shot, bottom’s up, this is no lie
i’ll be beating this guitar ’til the day i die

[hook]
live fast, on high
repentless, let it ride

what you get is what you see
we’re killing ourselves a little more everyday

live fast, on high

[verse 1]
drones since the dawn of time
compelled to live your sheltered lives
not once has anyone ever seen
such a rise of pure hypocrisy
i'll instigate, i'll free your mind
i'll show you what i've known all this time

[hook]
god hates us all, god hates us all
you know it's true, god hates this place
you know it's true, he hates this race

[verse 2]
homicide, suicide
hate heals, you should try it sometime
strive for peace with acts of war
the beauty of death we all adore
i have no faith distracting me
i know why your prayers will never be answered

[hook]
god hates us all, god hates us all
god hates us all, god hates us all
yeah, he fuckin' hates me

[verse 3]
pessimist, terrorist targeting the next mark
global chaos feeding on hysteria
cutthroat, slit your wrist, shoot you in the back, fair game
drug abuse, self-abuse, searching for the next high
sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time
i'm waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies

[refrain]
i never said i wanted to be god's disciple
i'll never be the one to blindly follow

[verse 4]
man-made virus infecting the world
self-destruct, human time bomb
what if there is no god? would you think the fucking same?
wasting your life in a leap of blind faith
wake the fuck up, can't ignore what i say
i got my own philosophy
i hate everyone equally
you can't tear that out of me
no segregation, separation
just me in my world of enemies

[refrain]
i never said i wanted to be god's disciple
i'll never be the one to blindly follow
i'll never be the one to bear the cross
disciple

[outro]
i reject this fuckin' race

[verse 1]
existing on damnation's edge
the priest had never known
to witness such a violent show
of power overthrown
angels fighting aimlessly
still dying by the sword
our legions killing all in sight
to get the one called lord

[chorus 1]
the gates of hell lie waiting, as you see
there's no price to pay, just follow me
i can take your lost soul from the grave
jesus knows your soul can not be saved

[post-chorus 1]
crucify your so-called "lord"
he soon shall fall to me
your souls are damned, your god has fell
to slave for me eternally
hell awaits

[verse 2]
the reaper guards the darkened gates
that satan calls his home
demons feed the furnace where
the dead are free to roam
lonely children of the night
there's seven ways to go
each leading to the burning hole
that lucifer controls

[chorus 2]
priests of hades seek the sacred star
satan sees the answer lies not far
zombies, screaming souls, cry out to you
satanic law prevails, your life is through

[bridge]
pray to the moon, when it is round
death with you shall then abound
for what you seek for can't be found
in sea or sky or underground

[lead - hanneman]

[verse 3]
now i have you deep inside
my everlasting grasp
the seven bloody gates of hell
is where you'll live your last
warriors from hell's domain
will bring you to your death
the flames of hades burning strong
your soul shall never rest

[chorus 1]
the gates of hell lie waiting, as you see
there's no price to pay, just follow me
i can take your lost soul from the grave
jesus knows your soul can not be saved

[post-chorus 2]
sacrifice the lives of all
i know they soon shall die
their souls are damned to rot in hell
and keep the fires growing deep inside
hell awaits

[lead - king] [verse 1]
propaganda death ensemble, burial to be
corpses rotting through the night, in blood-laced misery
scorched earth, the policy, the reason for the siege
the pendulum, it shaves the blade, the strafing air blood raid

[verse 2]
infiltration push reserves, encircle the front lines
supreme art of strategy, playing on the minds
bombard 'till submission, take all to their graves
indication of triumph: the numbers that are dead

[chorus 1]
sport the war
war support
the sport is war, total war
when victory's really massacre
the final swing is not a drill
it's how many people i can kill

[lead - hanneman]

[chorus 2]
sport the war
war support
the sport is war, total war
when victory's really survival
the final swing is not a drill
it's how many people i can kill

[bridge 1]
be dead, be from above
when darkness falls
descend onto my sights
your fallen walls
spearhead break through the lines
flanked all around
soldiers of attrition
forward their ground

[bridge 2]
regime prophetic age
old in its time
flowing veins run on through
deep in the rhine
center of the web
all battles scored
what is our war crimes
era forever more
war

[lead - king]

[verse 3]
propaganda war ensemble, burial to be
bones, shining by the night, in blood-laced misery
campaign of elimination, twisted psychology
when victory is to survive, and death is defeat

[chorus 3]
sport the war
war support
the sport is war, total war
when the end is a slaughter
the final swing is not a drill
it's how many people i can kill [verse 1]
you go to the church, you kiss the cross
you will be saved at any cost
you have your own reality, christianity
you spend your life just kissing ass
a trait that's grown as time has passed
you think the world will end today
you praise the lord, that's all you say

[chorus 1]
jesus saves
listen to you pray
you think you'll see the pearly gates when death takes you away

[verse 2]
for all respect, you cannot lust
in an invisible man you place your trust
indirect dependency
eternal attempt at amnesty
he will decide who lives and dies
depopulate, satanic rise
you will be an accessory
irreverence and blasphemy

[lead - king]

[chorus 2]
jesus saves
no need to pray, the gates of pearl have turned to gold
it seems you've lost your way

[lead - hanneman]

[outro]
jesus saves
no words of praise, no promised land to take you to
there is no other way [produced by rick rubin]

[verse 1]
funeral held for the depression of man
holds the key to his own death
entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
tighten the tourniquet around your neck
sifting away the debris of hated life
cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
seeking life beyond your perishment
repeating words echoing through your mind

[verse 2]
chanting lines of blind witchery
to save yourself from extinction
wanting to die is your reason to live
new life born from the oppressed
taste your blood as it trickles through the air
another casualty, beyond the shadows you fall
losing ground, the fate you feel draws near
fatality, reality, await the final call

[instrumental break]

[verse 3]
my sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity
vessels in my brain carrying death until my birth
come and die with me forever, share insanity
do you wanna die?!

[verse 4]
the waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies
turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind
non-rising body from the grave showing new reality
what i am, what i want, i’m only after death [verse 1]
disease spreading death, entire population dies
dead before you're born, massive suicide

vicious game of fear, it's all extermination now
poison in your veins, global genocide

slaughter governs law, the apocalypse begins
pain becomes the norm, seeking homicide

beware the coming storm that starts illuminating fires
god is laughing hard, man has gone insane


[hook]
world painted blood, no sanctuary
world painted blood, no sanctuary


[verse 2]
tip the human scale, follow revelations' plan
it must come to pass, secret shadows lie

blueprint haunting dreams, in which manipulation wins
speak no hidden fears, religion neutralized

emerged from the dark, sadist mercenary ride
realm not of this world, godless messengers

sickless, mindless hate becomes evolutions cure
planets usher in, alignment god has died


[hook]
world paintved blood, no anctuary
world paintsdeblood, no sanctuary!

[bridge3]
god send death
watch it bleed
justified
manufactured lives born in hell

angels fall
wings on fire
crucified
terrorizing man, burn the world

reflecting eyes
sickle swings
wave of blood
suicidal mind from the start

endless pain
open wounds
slit the throat
radiation child seeks the throne


[verse 4]
strafing down
demigods
certain death
coming from the stars, lord of all

dark rift rise
flourish life
perish man
we destroy ourselves, cease to live

children's blood
feed the dead of sea of flesh
catastrophic fall
rest in hell

flaming corpse
screaming eyes
watch it die
walk among the dead, pick your grave


[lead: hanneman]


[hook 2 (4x)]
like a disease spreading death, erasing your existence
like a disease spreading death, erasing your existence


[verse 5]
satan's hand begins the end
and frees the world forever
gomorrah's dream to live in sin
has reached its critical mass
man himself has become god
and laughs at his destruction
in which we trust a secret government
is now in total collapse


[revisit verse 1]


[hook (2x)]


[hook 3 (3x)]
signs of disease, rivers red, blood in ice, plague


welcoming our death! [verse 1]
i have witnessed your death
i've seen it many times
your tortured screams
your decrepit little mind
a father's son
with pathetic eyes that bleed
twins in the end
begin and let the brothers fall

[chorus 1]
i will see you burned alive
screaming for your god
i will hunt you down again for him

[verse 2]
god won't judge what i've done
he crawls upon my feet
a privileged pain
beneath buried are your dead
on splintered bones i walk
sifting through the blood
besieged to fear
await the coming of the god

[chorus 2]
i will watch you die again for him

[verse 3]
blood is raining downward
the stain reflects the sun
conquer divide within
terrorize the mind
i've seen the end it's yours
rosary in hand
your selfish flesh it melts
spilling from the sky

[chorus 3]
i will see you burned alive
screaming for your god
i will watch you die

[hook]
this is god's war
god's war
this is god's war
god's war

[verse 4]
war of holy principles
i'm seeking god's help in your destruction
slit the throat of heathen man
and let his blood dilute the water
bury your dead

[verse 5]
fuck your god erase his name
a lady weeps insane with sorrow
i'll take his towers from the world
you're fucking raped upon your deathbed

[hook]
this is god's war
god's war
this is god's war
god's war
fucking holy war

[lead - hanneman]

[outro]
be optimistic, happy, and calm
show no fear or anxiety
smile at the face of god
and your reward will be eternity
holy warriors, your patience will be justified
everything is for him
you must not comfort the animal before you kill it
strike as champions at the heart of the nonbelievers
strike above the neck and at all extremities
for it's a point of no return for almighty god
god will give victory to his faithful servants
when you reach ground zero you will have killed the enemy
the great satan [verse 1]
eternal, the kiss i breathe
siphon your blood to me
feel my wounds of your god
forever rape mortality
i smell of death, i reek of hate, i will live forever
lost child, pay the dead
bleeding screams of silence
in my veins, your eternity

[chorus]
i'll kill you and your dreams tonight
begin new life
bleed your death upon me
let your bloodline feed my youth

[verse 2]
first breath born, come alive, learn to kill
bloodfest awaits to feed your hunger
dark side has no rival test, your faith in blood
night hides the hunting packs, a feeding frenzy

[chorus]
i'll kill you and your dreams tonight
begin new life
bleed your death upon me
let your bloodline feed my youth

[bridge]
i am the first, not the last
condemned by a single kiss
betrayed eternally
i'll rip inside your soul
contaminating the world
defying god and son
black heart that brings your death
living in infamy

drink the flesh of life itself
prepare to reign a thousand years

[outro]
bleed your death upon me
bleed your death upon me
bleed your death upon me
let your bloodline feed my youth
blame god's chosen children
as you die, i'm immortal
faithless, no religion
stalking prey is my confession
captive blood, enslavement
pain and hunger drives your madness
drink flesh, life itself
prepare to reign a thousand years [verse 1]
murder at your every footstep
a child's toy, sudden death
sniper blazes you through your knees
falling down, can you feel the heat?

offspring sent out to cry
living mandatory suicide

raked by machine gun fire
screaming soul sent out to die
living mandatory suicide

[outro]
lying, dying, screaming in pain
begging, pleading, bullets drop like rain
mines explode, pain sheers through your brain
radical amputation, this is insane
fly swatter stakes drive through your chest
spikes impale you as you're forced off the crest
soldier of misfortune
hunting with bated breath
a vile smell, like tasting death
dead bodies, dying and wounded
litter the city streets
shattered glass, bits of clothing and human deceit
dying in terror
blood's cheap, it's everywhere
mandatory suicide, massacre on the front line
aaaaaaahhhh [verse 1]
waiting the hour destined to die
here on the table of hell
a figure in white, unknown by man
approaching the altar of death
high priest awaiting, dagger in hand
spilling the pure virgin blood
satan's slaughter, ceremonial death
answer his every command

[verse 2]
death will come easy, just close your eyes
dream of the friends, you'll see
heavenly failure, losing again
move on to a new form of life

[chorus]
altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned
confronting the evil you dread
coalesce into one your shadow and soul

[verse 4]
a gift of powers disposed upon you
use them when you feel the need
master the forces and powers of satan
controlling the creature's instinct
drawn to the castles that float in the sky
learn to resist the temptation
watching the angels sift through the heavens
endlessly searching for salvation

modulistic terror
a vast sadistic feast

i'll send you to your maker

spells surround me day and night
stricken by the force of evil light

twisting my mind
fight to resist the evil inside
captive of a force of satan's might

nightmare, the persecution
a child's dream of death
torment, ill forgotten
a soul that will never rest
guidance, it means nothing
in a world of brutal time
electric, circus, wild

silent scream
bury the unwanted child
beaten and torn
sacrifice the unborn

beaten and torn
sanctify lives of scorn

strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain
limb dissection, amputation from a mind deranged
asphyxiation, suffocation, gasping for air
explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair?
ripping apart, severing flesh
gouging eyes, tearing limb from limb

necrophobic, can't control the paranoia
scared to die driving compulsion morbid thoughts come to mind
sexual release buried deep inside
complete control of a prized possession
to touch and fondle with no objection
lonely souls an emptiness fullfilled
physical pleasure and addictive thrill
an object of perverted reality
an obsession beyond your wildest dreams

death loves final embrace
your cool tenderness
memories keep love alive
memories will never die

the excitement of dissection is sweet
my skin crawls with orgasmic speed
a lifeless object for my subjection
an obsession beyond your imagination
primitive instinct a passion for flesh
primal feeding on the multitudes of death
sadistic acts a love so true
absorbingly masticating a part of you

death loves final embrace
your cool tenderness
memories keep love alive
memories will never die

i need a friend
please be my companion
i don't want to be
left alone with my sanity

erotic sensations tingle my spine
a dead body lying next to mine
smooth blue black lips

mine forever this sweet death
i cannot forget your soft breaths
panting excitedly with my hands around your neck

shades are drawn

what i've done
what's become of me
here i stand
above all that's been true
how i love
how i love to kill you [verse 1]

artificial fucking peace

generals in their slow defeat

memories linger in my brain
burning from the acid rain
a pain i never have won

lives extinguished in a rage

so nauseous i don't realize
incessantly feeding the flies

the last thing you see are my crazed eyes
the last thing you see are my eyes

fear lies beneath your facade
in panic you scream for your god
no way i'll ever abstain
blood falls from the ceiling like rain

patiently unleash my violence
ingesting the sweet sound of your silence
in darkness this feeling i love
to be covered in blood... blood from above

this violence finally sets me free
brings demons back to torture me
there's no god pulling at my strings
i'm above all sorrow faith can bring

disengaged i see your face
an adrenaline rush i can't replace
hands around your neck
your senses numb
staring into your eyes when the stillness comes [verse 1]
on your back, look on to me

face from death, more than insane
profane, pleading cries
watch you die inside, watch you die

my life's a constant battle
the rage of many men
homicidal maniac

hatred growing stronger
none survive my wrath
suffer from the throbbing pain

[lead - king] awaken
in a web like hell
how did i reach this place
why are they haunting me
i cannot look at god's face

paralysing
brilliant light
trying to run
want to scream, but cannot speak
i cannot look at god's face

blind my eyes, i cannot see
what is being done to me
in my mind is only pain
all the memories are drained

victimized
specimen
deathless torture
void with no mercy
black shroud blinds those who see

violated
naked before you i stand
shattered shrine of flesh and bone
god's piercing through my soul

segments of my life
morbid pieces of reality
twisted personality
many faces yet faceless
familiar things give way to strange
no mercy no reason just pain

fatal
sub-conscious control
threshhold of pain unfolds
transfixed martyr saving race
who am i to judge thy grace

awaken
in a web like hell
how did i reach this place
why are they haunting me
i cannot look at god's face

blind my eyes, i cannot see
what is being done to me
in my mind is only pain
all the memories are drained [verse 1]
cascaded darkness, walls close in on me
nailed shut, but my eyes still see
severe anguish as my body evolves
the pain of life after death, it resolves

emptiness in twilight's rebirth
the faint sounds of shoveled earth
madness growing as your mind dissolves
merely secret in my dreams

[lead - hanneman]

[pre-chorus]
night grows cold, twilight's near
on the edge of madness, the wounds are sheared
forms of hanging, flesh shredded carcass
no spared breath
imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode
dead soul
stone cold
out into the night

[chorus]
voices inside my head
hold me under
voices oppress
like roaring thunder
an echo bouncing inside my brain
how much can i take of the pain
the pain

[post-chorus]
a war raging deep inside my head
a split decision that will end with me dead
you see the agony in my eyes
protruding aimless
i think it's time to
die

a cannibal's desire feeds the fire
that burns in your head

intense pain eats away at your brain
thorazine pumping through your veins

holy man, open up your eyes
to the ways of the world you've been so blind
as the walls of religion come crashing down
how's the ignorance taste the second time around?

[pre-chorus]
tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end
tell me what it's like when the celebration begins

[chorus 1]
welcome to the horror of the revelation
tell me what you think of your savior now
i reject all the biblical views of the truth
dismiss it as the folklore of the times
i won't be force fed prophecies
from a book of untruths for the weakest mind
join the new faith for the celebration
cult of new faith fuels the devastation

[verse 2]
holy man, come and worship me
i am all that you ever wanted to be
i'm the life of indulgence you never knew
the epitome of evil shining through

[pre-chorus]
tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end
tell me what it's like when the celebration begins

[chorus 2]
welcome to the horror of the revelation
tell me what you think of your savior now
i reject all the biblical views of the truth
dismiss it as the folklore of the times
i won't be force fed prophecies
from a book of untruths for the weakest mind
i keep the bible in a pool of blood
so that none of its lies can affect me

[verse 3]
this is new faith
a different way of life
witness the shame
see for yourself the lies
i'll take the fight
bring it every time, any time
refuse to let them win
my heresy begins

[refrain]
pray for life, wish for death
pray for life, know, in time, you'll pray for death

[verse 4]
tear it away
it lives inside your mind
silence the fear
that keeps you pure inside
now you can see
life's atrocities endlessly
witness the miracle

[verse 1]
a misty night, a perfect night
beneath the cold of the frozen star
you feel the fright, you know i'm near
you never should have come this far
i'm alive, you can't kill me
i will survive eternity

[verse 2]
go through the fire, walk past the dead
lost in my eternal maze
your heart pounds through the mist-filled air
your concentration breaks for me to strike
you've cowered down, you've broken the chain
now i can freeze your burning eyes

[lead - hanneman]

[verse 3]
you see me lift the axe, as it plunges through your shield
you now begin to panic, as you see your chances grow slim
you're running through the endless maze
you turn and i'll be there
a force too strong for you to fight
i'll see your end tonight

[verse 4]
you think you can destroy me? you'd better think again
i am eternal terror, my quest will never end
i'll trap you in the pentagram
and seal your battered tomb
your life is just another game
for satan's night of doom this fucking country's lost it's grip
sub-conscious hold begins to slip
the scales of justice begin to tip

the legal system has no spine
it's corroding from inside
slap your hand and you'll do no time

reality on vacation
all across a blinded nation
mentally under sedation

anyone can be set free
on a technicality
explain the law again to me

here in 1994
things are different than before
violence is what we adore

invitation to the game
guns and blades and media fame
every day more of the same

murder, mayhem, anarchy
now are all done legally
mastermind your killing spree

unafraid of punishment
with a passive government
there's nothing for you to regret

nothing to regret

unimposing policy
no enforcing ministry
gaping with judicial flaws
watch a fading nation crawl

clashing with the public's frame
i'm the one that's place in fame
legislature sets the stage
social slaves caught in my rage
administrative anarchy there's nothing
you can do to me
the world around you is drifting to a
continental tomb you see
violence is my passion
i will never be contained
living with aggression and it's
everlasting reign [verse 1]
fate, silent warriors, sleeping souls will rise
once forgotten soldiers come to life
fallen mercenary, dormancy is done
not content with wars we've never won

[chorus]
memories can't ignore
anguish of before
satisfy the scorn
rise, ghosts of war

[verse 2]
target, assassinate, time of your life has expired
hatred, victimize, gaze in their eyes as they die
violence, inflicting of pain, savage morticians deny
drive the salt in the wound, arouse the subconscious to lie

[chorus]
memories can't ignore
anguish of before
satisfy the scorn
rise, ghosts of war

[lead - king and hanneman]

[outro]
i deal in pain
all life, i drain
i dominate
i seal your fate
i deal in pain
all life, i drain
memories can't ignore
rise, ghost of war i stab you right between the eyes
you awaken from the lies
i said it ever since the inception
where the masters of deception
i'm a godless heretic
not a god-fearing lunatic
that's why it's become my obsession
to treat god like an infection

my scars insane, my life profane
i deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!

like a storm that devastates
religious doubt i instigate
take a listen to my confession
there is no filter on my aggression
with a blister open wide
to keep the massacre alive
i got cold devastation
with my moral imperfection

my scars insane, my life profane
i deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!

religious death, i instigate
from what the bible demonstrates
does it document creation
of this hopeless infliction
of a godless heretic
not a god-fearing lunatic
that's why it's become my obsession
to treat god like an infection

my scars insane, my life profane
i deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!

open life scars, crushing open wounds
the walls of this scene will be crashing at you
you left senseless mentally unfit
never fucking heard from you again
never fucking heard from again [verse 1]
voice is a weapon; bombs are away
mind's a trigger, fire away
world's in a crossfire, of panic and fear
the war is upon us; i say it starts here

[chorus 1]
we will take control
of this abortion called society
i despise the mediocrity
inject the system with something new
a social terror to lead the few

[verse 2]
why call it the land of the free?
political banter, if you ask me
diffusing a problem, the question is how
with imminent conflict, the answer starts now

[verse 3]
i can say
we're not the answer to the world's decay
here to stay
we're just the ones who won't go away

[chorus 2]
we will take control
of this disaster called society
i despise the mediocrity
so now i'm going to introduce
a social terror that's on the loose

[guitar solo]

[verse 4]
i am the propaganda war machine
the face of fury and obscenity
so when society has gone astray
i'll be the one to pave the way
they'll never fuck with my reality
cause this right here to me is unity
when all is done, we'll have always shown
a domination that was never known

[chorus 3]
we will take control
of this abortion called society
i despise the mediocrity
we are the torch that lights the fuse
a social terror with nothing to lose [intro - not spoken]
even though some things are better left unsaid
there's a few things i need to get off my chest
i need to vent, let me tell you why

[verse 1]
i'm suicidal, maniacal, self-destructive
you leave me no hope, no life
nothing worth living for
i've taken it, can't take it anymore
my worst nightmare
you make me want to slit my own fucking throat
just so i'll be rid of you
just to get rid of you

[chorus 1]
you self-righteous fuck
give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off
why don't you take a good look in these eyes
cause i'm the one that's gonna tear your fucking heart out
my hate is contagious, you've got no one to run to
exile
exile
exile
exile

[verse 2]
just tell me fucking why everything becomes an issue
your opinion is always senseless, fuck this
you make my fucking skin crawl
i've lived with it, can't stand anymore
my worst nightmare
i want to take a bullet in the fucking head
every time i think of you
every time i think of you

[chorus 2]
you self-righteous fuck
give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off
why don't you take a good look in these eyes
cause i'm the one that's gonna tear your fucking heart out
my hate is contagious
anyone else need to vent?
you've tried my tolerance, i just want you to die

[lead - hanneman]

[bridge]
there's nothing more for me to say
there's nothing more for you to say
there's nothing more for us to say
i fucking hate you anyway
exile
exile
exile
exile

[outro]
can't count the ways that you light my fuckin' fuse
i can't tolerate the sight of you, the thought of you
or anything about you
you know what i want to see?
how many ways can a loser fucking lose?
i know you'll find a way
the humility awakening the idiot inside
you spineless fucking maggot, you're just wasting my time
get out of my face, get out of my life
out of my fucking way, just die [verse 1]
evangelist, you claim god speaks through you
your restless mouth, full of lies, gains popularity
you care not for the old that suffer
when empty pockets cry from hunger

[chorus 1]
penniless from their generosity
sharing their money to quench your greed
searching for the answer to their prayers
they cry their last wish of need
save me

[verse 2]
his spirit lives and breathes in me
the almighty transformed to your screen
the meanings lost in its translation
no holy words, describe his deception

[chorus 2]
you say you'll help us find the lord
tell me, preacher, how do you know?
a simple quest for a visible savior
to lead us through our final prayer
save me

[bridge 1]
send your donations, contribute to the cause
luxuries, your righteous reward
praise the lord, praise god, is what you wish to sell
there is no heaven without a hell

[lead - king]

[bridge 2]
in your mind's eye, could you truly believe
that by giving, you can save your soul
could you be so naïve?
you heal the sick, you raise the dead
you blind the congregation
with the things you say
religious blackmail, a deceit of trust
that death will come and all will be lost
can you hear the serpents call
look deep in those deceiving eyes
ignore the writing on the wall
you should read between the lies

[outro]
when doubt subsides his honesty
an inquiry, is it blasphemy?
impure the soul, that's made to suffer
no sermons left to hide or cover
an empty promise, lie unfulfilled
to steal a dream or get it killed
they claim your trip to heavens nearby
you may believe it but satan wouldn't lie i never thought the taste of you would be the only thing to make me bleed
why am i so alive while you lay still in the ground beneath me?

fear of death the dark inside
have become your only children
they're in front of you
watching you
lost screams, unholy dreams, unrest
i laugh at your god as he's passing through

slicing at your throat to warm my skin
never thought it'd come to this
what the fuck?
i've gone wrong no rest

your children still call
can't you hear them screaming out your name?
you've gone insane
they're in my head
they want you to die in front of me, die in front of me

thinking why me?
wishing this was all a dream
insanity, reality
you're going to die in front of me

pestilence is here
death awaits
your body is not of christ
it's my alter

helpless and alone
violate
enveloped in my skin
faceless canvass

tearing at your flesh
bathed in blood
violently regress
death's so endless

brutal is your pain
anguish is a game
broken and afraid
god can't help you now

you'll wish you were in hell [3x]

ghostly figures are always standing still
are they mocking me?
what do they see?

i didn't want your death to end so fast
but once you start, you cannot stop
i need it now to fucking last

die in front of me
die in front of me

thinking why me?
wishing this was all a dream
insanity, reality
you're going to die in front of me

pestilence is here
death awaits
your body is not of christ
it's my alter

brutal is your pain
anguish is a game
broken and afraid
god can't help you now

[lead: hanneman]

you'll wish you were in hell [4x]

i never thought the taste of you would be the only thing to make me bleed

all alone in my funeral home
playing in blood
there's just got to be
something's wrong with me

draining veins
it's all the same
the torture in my head
it won't stop until i am fucking dead

pestilence is here
death awaits
your body is not of christ
it's my alter

helpless and alone
violate
enveloped in my skin
faceless canvass

tearing at your flesh
bathed in blood
violently regress
death's so endless

brutal is your pain
anguish is a game
broken and afraid
god can't help you now

you'll wish you were in hell [3x] [verse 1]
come walk with me through endless time

no regard of human life

on controversy and madness we feed
it's a rush you can't deny
a little violence is the ultimate drug

sells you peace then defies you with his insolence
greed and power his vices give him what he seeks

self-control defies you

not for love, for the enemy
fanatical zeal will bring this to an end
divine providence the world's end

drink the war
piano wire plays
your body hangs
piano wire plays

[chorus]
take the war
taste the blood
attack and continue
never surrender
we shall be victorious
attack
never surrender [intro]
mankind, in his insatiable search for divine knowledge
has discarded all biblical teachings
realizing that the strength of religion
is the repression of knowledge
all structures of religion have collapsed
life prays for death
in the wake of the horror of these revelations
it was never imagined how graphic the reality
that would be known as the end of creation
would manifest itself
we believe all this chaos and atrocity can be traced
back to one single event

[outro]
we hold these truths to be painfully self-evident
all men are not created equal
only the strong will prosper
only the strong will conquer
only in the darkness of christ have i realized
god hates us all
god hates us all i am the last of the dying insane
you would scream at the things i've done
knowing now that the dead still see
my blood it runs like mercury
your last breath the sword comes down
she dies first speaking death to me
philosophy, the vision, the view within
duty, science, abstract cruelty

what are your final thoughts?
do you want to kill me or die in shame?
from my point of view
justified action, the enemy burns

the fun of massacre in the brain
bio-weapons and i are the same
look at their face, hatred in their blood
pile up the dead, my humanity
x-rays burn all that you can see
nobody knows what a body can stand
skulls on fire yet mercy is worse
you seek only your pleasure in death

what are your final thoughts?
do you want to kill me or die in shame?
from my point of view
justified action, the enemy burns

bacterial target, eyes exploding
melting flesh through your mind
become your madness insanity wins
infant's flesh on the walls
testing limits, threshold of pain
ripping out teeth to observe
i want blood!

[instrumental break]

knowing now the dead still see
my blood it runs like mercury
knowing now the dead still see
my blood it runs like mercury
knowing now the dead still see
my blood it runs like mercury
knowing now the dead still see
my blood it runs like mercury

human brain experiment
on prisoners, open skull
vivisection, live dissection
repulsing to the core

what are your final thoughts?
do you want to kill me or die in shame?
from my point of view
justified action, the enemy burns

fuckin' burns!

pathogens seek a horrible end
churning factories of death
crematoriums see your crime
you will see me in hell [verse 1]
when war cries echoing all begin
never know any other way to fight, just win
blood of the enemy when penance is due
you know that sacrifice starts with you!

[chorus]
cast the first stone
stand in my way
it's vengeance you owe
with blood, you will pay!

[verse 2]
i live for battle the intensity knows no peer
your defiance will prove severe
choking on blood, beaten in pain
realizing the fighting is all in vain

[chorus]
cast the first stone
stand in my way
it's vengeance you owe
with blood, you will pay!

when war cries echo sacrifice is you!

[instrumental]

[verse 3]
can feel that sweeping everywhere i walk?
like a devastating fire every time i talk!
man infested component you can't stop
a block of granite on my shoulder you can't knock off!

[chorus]
cast the first stone
stand in my way
it's vengeance you owe
with blood, you will pay! [verse 1]
eyes upon me
watching me in my perpetual sleep
dreams deceive me
my future depends on a mindless dream

[pre-chorus 1]
i've fallen from promises
damned to take risks on my own
the masterful science that freezes your
mind and your soul

[chorus 1]
the wretched dream is realized
the human race is to be crystallized

[verse 2]
thoughts of laughter
filling the head of the master in charge
worlds of wonder
is this a cure or a painless death?

[pre-chorus 2]
i'll fight and resist
till they all see the end that is near
the doctors the lawyers and demons
are living in fear

[chorus 2]
living my life with one distant hope
a cure that will kill this invincible foe

unbound god's creation
has grown into the sinner
abandoned innocence
impenitent transgressor
escape mortality

if you take god's hand
embrace rebirth
your cleansing's so divine
to be reborn in god's eyes

[chorus 1]
you'll never touch god's hand
you'll never taste god's breath
because you'll never see the second coming
life's too short to be focused on insanity
i've seen the ways of god
i'll take the devil any day
hail satan

[verse 2]
your faith has atrophied
and rots in hell's asylum
despondence tears you down
a free-falling social stain
escape atrocity

embrace rebirth
your cleansing's so divine
to be reborn in god's lies

[chorus 2]
you'll never touch god's hand
you'll never taste god's breath
because you'll never see the second coming
it's all a fuckin' mockery
no grasp upon reality
it's mind control for
compulsory religion and the skeleton christ

[chorus 3]
you'll never touch god's hand
you'll never taste god's breath
because you'll never see the second coming
i laugh at the abortion known as christianity
i've seen the ways of god
i'll take the devil any day
hail satan

[chorus 2]
you'll never touch god's hand
you'll never taste god's breath

gemini master of demise
your death is my salvation
to a kingdom mine
my lord is my light
the master of darkness
your death is my salvation
to a kingdom mine

[verse 2]
you look at me with eyes of fate
and see the graphic truth
your ignorance cannot shield you
from your naked abuse

numbing of your moral sense
facing reality
that life is unconditional
and death is only the beginning

the pain will never end...

[verse 3]
walking slow, breathing heavy
you could see death sweat
how it shined
an argument out of control in my mind

i am here for the sole purpose of your death
walking slow breathing heavy
you can see death sweat

i am here for the sole purpose of your death
look into my eyes and see the revelation of your demise
feel the pain that stares at the center of your heart
reflections of my soul
reflections of the dark [verse 1]
a soldier's heart
reflecting back at me
i keep seeing mutilated faces
even in my dreams
distorted images
flashing rapidly
psychotically abusing me
devouring my brain

[chorus 1]
the eyes of the insane
on a demented campaign

[verse 2]
tortured spirits
will not let me rest
these thoughts of mutilated faces
completely possessed
fragmented images
flashing rapidly
psychotically abusing me
whirling through my head

[chorus 2]
shellshocked, battle fatigue
overwhelming anxiety
flashbacks. panic attacks
death raising its ugly face at me

ripping through my soul
evil's relentless hostility
won't let me sleep

[chorus 3]
shellshocked, battle fatigue
devastating insanity
flashbacks. panic attacks
death's riding, he's coming for me [verse 1]
deceased in mind, decree of death
blackened heart baptized in fire
exertion, now need to blitz
vicious ways brought up in hell
draw the line, life or death
potent thrust, excessive pain
massive dose, adrenaline
minor threat cannot decline

[chorus]
stricken to live, hell on earth
shackled and bound, we lie
praise of death, life's a dream
we're only living to die

[verse 2]
victim of life, insanity lives
deep in shock, intensive care
tables turned, blast of strength
kill at once, time to prevail
begin to crank, feel the rush
start to rage, take to extremes
push too far, overkill
time to die, no way to win

stricken to live, hell on earth
shackled and bound, we lie
praise of death, life's a dream

at mach 10 velocity
pressure builds, can't take the strain
life blood flows to its grave
dripping sweat, death shall erase
time to think, time to breathe
feel the pulse, life will expire
surging speed, hell-a-fast
cardiac, cease to exist

[chorus]
stricken to live, hell on earth
shackled and bound, we lie
praise of death, life's a dream

i saw them all around today
they don't stop, they won't go away
they love the darkness in my eyes
help me find a way out when i'm lost within myself
lost within myself
when i'm lost within myself

[pre-chorus 1]
they show me everything i need
there's nothing wrong with a little greed
never enough to satisfy
such a driving desire that burns inside
my life came with its own scars
i don't need you to tell me about your sorrow
i can't say i've seen it all
but i live for the things that keep me hollow

[chorus]
every day, i look into the mirror
staring back, i look less familiar
i've seen all seven faces
each one looks a lot like me

[interlude]
they all look like me
i never see them coming
but they show me more of myself
drawn into the depths
i never knew existed
launching me face first
into the pleasures of pure lust and greed

[bridge]
i am becoming all things envied, i am the excess
i want it all, more pain, more sex, more lies
more of everything

have you ever felt the need
to see more than you can see
look into uncertainty
reflections of treachery
would you leave the world behind
endless life is here to find
i can interest you in lies
sell your soul for all it buys

[chorus]
play with your insanity
shatter your reality
pulsing in your blood

[verse 2]
i can satisfy your greed
for now all your debts are free
i have all eternity
to quench all the death i breed
recreate the rules of play
from now things are done my way
none have ever won my game
crucified them all in flames

play with your insanity
shatter your reality
pulsing in your blood

have you ever danced with the devil
his temptation ever summoned you
ever penned your name in blood
let possession slowly swallow you

the attraction mesmerizes you
have you ever wondered why
it seems that evil you're attracted to

[outro]
reach out to my hand
step back in time's sand
genetic wasteland
far beyond death caught
now you're mine
i am the master of your whipping time
the smile
on my lips
the look of horror on your face
self
justification
can't rid the sexual fascination
can
you deny
my face of pleasure the gleam in my eye

you're nothing
an object of animation
a subjective mannequin
beaten into submission
raping again and again

shackled
my princess
dangling in distress
here
to discipline
my sole purpose never ends
bleeding
on your knees
my satisfaction is what i need
the urge
to take my fist
and violate every orifice

you're nothing
an object of animation
a subjective mannequin
beaten into submission
raping again and again

slaves to my torment
scream to your heart's content
time and time again
pleasure in inflicting pain
power so insane
trying to circumvent
unadulterated battery
manipulated reality
god is dead - i am alive! body count
laid out mutilated
it's your time to die
desolate
lure kill satisfaction
climax with your death
all alone
my prey intimidated
feed my lust for fear
dehumanise
cry out stimulated
your screams fill my soul

systematic death
a physical fear
psychopathy red
after death gratification

graphic dreams
played out insatiable
can't control the urge
innocence
drop dead suicidal
a pain that i posses
vindictive
past crimes insidious
this is my redemption
violate
force down penetrate
your eyes reflecting horror

systematic death
a physical fear
psychopathy red
after death gratification

perversion
slow death agonizing
stab around the eyes
flow of blood
warm taste brings me pleasure
eclipsing all reason
pushing sperm
in her imitation
painful act in vain
organs cooked, bled out potency
now i am complete

systematic death
a physical fear
psychopathy red
after death gratification [verse 1]
you can never truly see
inside the ones you know
until you've found them near
the edge of self-control
all i hear are lies
you're lying to yourself
and everything is out of control
you're just a fuckin' slave of discontent
i'm sick of watching you dig this hole

[pre-chorus]
time waits for no one
won't stop, it can't be outrun
you know that pain in your head
won't stop 'til the desperation ends

[chorus]
you've found yourself chasing death
oblivious until the end
you'll never stop chasing death

[verse 2]
innocence, common sense, i don't see the relevance
of anything that you've got to say
parasite, socialite, you're never gonna win this fight
there is no fucking easy way out
no easy way out

[verse 3]
i know i should have seen it all coming
but i had to find it out on my own
a whore to incompetence you hide behind
the shadow that once was your throne
control is a discipline even when
frustration just stands in your way
the throes of insanity feel just like
a war inside you every day

no easy way out so is it just me
or everyone can see
the world drowning in it's own blood
humanity's decline
dismantled over time
a fossil drying in the mud
it's deception and the greed
that germinates the seed
of dissent growing all around
is this the beginning or the end
in darkness we descend
and i can't wait to see it all go down

standing room only all the world will attend
front row center to the ultimate end
mankind constantly parading its flaws
tangled in charades of the orthodox laws

like a firestorm raging out of control
ignorance of all has taken its toll
it seems that blame is your personal hell
dish it out to anyone but never yourself

implode, no resurrection of divine
implode, extermination of the swine

sick of this shit called policy
life support for a dead economy
brain dead leaders of the world conspire
acting with malice only fuels the fire

no wonder people of religion obsess
all it wants a man to do is confess
arrogance will never let the fools concede
you know you're gonna have to stand and watch them bleed

implode, cleansation of mankind
implode, extermination of the swine

so many still ask why
i've said a million times
there's nothing godly looking over us
it's just the choice you make
i'll still inject the hate
that brings finality to the fuss
society will bleed
so watch the violence breed
and deconstruct the protocol
and if i'm proven wrong
i think you know the song
i'm pretty sure that god still hates us all

standing room only all the world will attend
front row center to the ultimate end
mankind constantly parading its flaws
tangled in charades of the orthodox laws
no wonder people of religion obsess
all it wants a man to do is confess
arrogance will never let the fools concede
you know you're gonna have to stand and watch them bleed

implode, cleansation of mankind
implode, extermination of the swine

no resurrection of divine
extermination of the swine
it's the cleansation of mankind
no resurrection of divine
extermination of mankind it's the feel of your blood
as it flows smoothly down my skin
intoxicating my soul
immortality, seducing me

burning in your own hell, which now binds you to me infinitely
spirits of angels don't weep for you enticing me
vanity, blood
left for you to drink

eternity waits for you
vanity, blood
left for you to drink
eternity waits for you to drink

frozen in time is the ice flowing in your veins
are you insane?
at your mercy they suffered while you sat there painless
vile and shameless

crowned you are now for the merciless sins
it's the end
your beauty through order is where blood flows through you
where it begins

vanity, blood
left for you to drink
eternity waits for you
vanity blood

left for you to drink
eternity waits for you to drink
young life striped down of all it's dignity
sliced flesh pours out it's youthfulness

my lust will never be fully quenched
your screams tell me that you're not prepared to die

[lead: king]

creature from hell why can't you see the things i see?
mirror tells me that you were always meant for me
you are my sacrifice
blood is the deficit

biting the flesh, face my sick prelude
now meet your frozen death
god did not do this
heated iron bar i will insert inside your cunt

mistress of cruelty, a name that will not die
you are my sacrifice
blood is the deficit
bathing in blood, your heart, your soul, your god

it all belongs to me
god belongs to me
it all belongs to me

despair, emptiness
see the hatred wasted on yourself
face down, taste the dust, it's getting harder everyday
just to find a reason not to end it all yourself
suicide on the street
everywhere around you watch it breed
it begins to bury you in self-induced rejection
so now you're wasted, broken down
i see through your ignorance
penetrate the surface of your insecure inside
next fix, shoot it up
looking for the place where god speaks
every time you find him
he just stabs you in the back again

isolation rapes you everyday
face down taste the dust, digging deeper in your grave
haven't found a reason
haven't found a thing to fucking live for

you're left here just to waste away
in your cardboard prison, asphalt wasteland

take a deep breath
'cause it all starts now
when you pull the fuckin' pin
the shrapnel burns as it tears into the skin
ever wonder what it takes to be questioning your faith?
this is what it's like when it happens every goddamn day
violence is our way of life
shards of life like confetti in the air
the flesh storm grows as it breeds despair
you hear screams in the distance fighting the resistance
not cries of war
these are just the sounds of pain

it's all just psychotic devotion
manipulated with no discretion

killing's in style and it's now the main event
the cameras are whores for the daily bloodshed
like a junkie, hungry for a fix of anything
the media devours and feasts upon the inhumane
violence is our way of life
it's all too fuckin' clear we can never coincide
so let's all drink to genocide
all the venomous sights border on the arcane
in times of war, everything is bound by pain

when adrenaline takes control
can't beat the rush
that leaves a suicidal hold

instinct spares no one
destroying the human heart
the taste of blood
can rip your soul apart

devils that drive us
do not discriminate
a state of mind
that becomes the ultimate end

action reaction
blood line is not immune
to the depth of human nature
inside of me and you
a sociopath with empty eyes
and no soul
paranoid psychotic heart of stone
my blood runs cold

evils of passion
can drive reason to extremes
love, hate and murder
temporary insanity

on the edge of a
demented personality
emotional
pain is a deadly reality

a sociopath with empty eyes
and no soul
paranoid psychotic heart of stone
my blood runs cold

a choice is made of free will
just like the choice to kill
decisions to lose control
my self-destructive rationale

a choice is made, made of free will
just like the choice, the choice to kill
in the speed of a moment
life stands still now you're standing in my killing field

a choice is made of free will
just like the choice to kill

life stands still now you're standing in my killing field [verse 1]

• tom araya: slayer frontman/bassist
• kerry king: slayer guitarist
• dave lombardo: former slayer drummer
• kathryn hanneman: wife of jeff hanneman
• gary holt: longtime friend of jeff hanneman and current slayer fill-in guitarist

when news broke in the early evening of may 2, 2013, that longtime slayer guitarist jeff hanneman had succumbed to liver failure at age 49, a shockwave of atomic force rippled its way across the metal community that left many stunned

as facebook and twitter became overrun with postings of shock, grief and recollections from fans who had spent the better part of their lives following slayer like rottweiler puppies, you could feel it—this one was different. this one hurt

to anyone who came of age in the mid eighties wearing a denim jacket and studded wristband, slayer was their introduction to aggressive speed metal, with riffs that cut like a buzzsaw blade and dark lyrical themes that often crossed into objectionable territory—and hanneman was the primary force behind it

“by all accounts, he was the band,” says slayer frontman and bassist tom araya

for those who had spent a lifetime in a perpetual state of whiplash from headbanging to such hanneman-penned slayer anthems as “angel of death,” “south of heaven,” “chemical warfare” and “raining blood,” the reason he meant so much to so many was simple: because you could always count on jeff to be jeff, in the same way you could always count on slayer to be slayer

he didn’t say much, but he didn't have to. he wrote the lion’s share of the band’s most beloved songs and lived to come out from behind a wall of marshalls every time the band took the stage, raise his fist triumphantly to the rafters, and destroy. for nearly three decades, jeff hanneman was a fixture of that stage—a blonde symbol of young headbangers who fell in love with satanic-infused heavy metal aggression and never looked back well into their adulthood

“i’m amazed at how many people he touched,” araya says. “they hardly knew him, but he affected a lot of people. and he didn’t even realize it.”

but for all the love the heavy metal community had for jeff hanneman, there was a dark side to the guitarist that confused many of those who came into contact with him. unlike, say, dimebag darrell, jeff wasn’t everybody’s “bro.” he didn’t pose happily for pictures, glad-hand his way across the namm convention floor every january or help needy children. he had no love for the media

he also had a morbid fascination with nazi germany and derived a perverse sense of joy from proudly—and controversially—displaying nazi iconography on his guitars. and he drank. a lot

“if he didn’t like you, he wouldn’t be hanging with you,” says araya from his family farmstead in buffalo, texas. “he could pick at you and make you feel like crap. but if you tolerated it and stuck it out and showed that you could deal with the bullshit, then that’s how you became friends with him.”

slayer’s origins date back to 1981 in the south gate and huntington park areas of los angeles. king and hanneman met at a warehouse complex after king had gone there to investigate a band that was holding auditions for a guitar player

“as i was leaving, i saw jeff just kinda standing around playing guitar, and he was playing stuff that i was into, like def leppard’s ‘wasted’ and ac/dc and priest. so i started talking to him and just said, ‘hey, you want to start a band?’ i already knew dave [lombardo, drummer] and we had been playing together in his parents’ garage a bit, and so i brought jeff in, then went to tom [araya, vocalist/bassist], who i was playing with in another band, and said, ‘hey man, i have a different band if you’re interested.’ and that was it.”

lombardo remembers the first time he met hanneman: “kerry brought him to rehearsal in the garage one day. he had a small fender twin and the black les paul that’s on the back of show no mercy, and he was kinda quiet

jeff hadn’t been playing for very long at that point, and everything he did know he basically taught himself. but something about it just felt right from the get-go. it worked.”

this fearsome foursome was now a unit, hell-bent on fusing elements of iron maiden, motörhead, dead kennedys and venom into an aggressive style of thrash metal that would ultimately alter the course of music. they were four youngsters with a shared vision, though hanneman did stand apart from his cohorts in one respect: he didn’t drive

so while everyone else was able to get to and from rehearsal via their own wheels, hanneman—who, depending on whom you ask, either never had a driver’s license or lost it early on after various dui infractions—needed to be shuttled back and forth whenever the band got together

“when we started the band, kerry would pick him up from his house in long beach and i would drop him off after rehearsal,” araya says. “that was the trade-off. so we spent a lot of time in the car together, usually drinking beer. i would drop him off, and sometimes i’d hang with him at his house with his parents.”

it was around this time—april-may 1983 to be exact, nine months before the release of the band’s debut album, show no mercy—that hanneman met a girl named kathryn. they hooked up as teenagers—he 19, she 15—and stuck together like glue for the remainder of jeff’s life, up until the day he died. it’s safe to say their fate as a couple was sealed by the bizarre circumstances of their introduction

“my girlfriend and i were getting tired of going to the movies every weekend, so we decided to go see this band called slayer at a little club in buena park called the woodstock,” says kathryn, who is now 46, from her home in southern california. “they were playing with a band called leatherwolf. i begged my father to let us go to the show, knowing that i would be home later than my 10 o’clock curfew, and he was okay with that. there may have been 15 or 20 people at the show, so i was able to stand up front against the stage, on jeff’s side. and before i knew it, he kneeled down, grabbed me by the hair, and started making out with me. i was blown away, and that was how we met.”

had hanneman attempted this act of onstage molestation with a different girl that night, he may have found himself in the back of a squad car. instead, he found himself getting messages from the band’s manager that kathryn—who had reached out to management to share photos she had taken that night—wanted jeff to call her

“i asked the manager if he could have jeff call me, and he told me jeff was in vegas visiting his grandmother,” she says. “i thought that was so sweet. about three weeks later, i was at home and my phone rang one night, and i picked it up and the voice on the other end said, ‘hi, kathy, this is jeff from slayer.’ and my heart started racing. i asked him how his grandmother was, and he said to me, ‘i wasn’t visiting my grandmother. i went to vegas to break up with my girlfriend.’ and that was what i loved about jeff—he was honest from the get-go.”

jeff and kathryn’s relationship continued to grow as slayer gained traction within the underground metal community—that is, as long they could figure out a way to travel the 20 or so miles between her home in buena park and his in long beach

“since neither of us drove we either had to rely on tom to pick me up and drive me to rehearsal to see jeff or get my mom to drive me to long beach to see him,” kathryn says. “and whenever jeff could, he would take a bus to come see me. that’s how our relationship started, and eventually we just never separated unless he was on the road. we spent as much time together as we possibly could

“at first my dad was a little nervous when this guy showed up at our house wearing a leather jacket with black makeup around his eyes, but it didn’t take long before they were all getting along great. my parents loved him. all my girlfriends fell in love with him too. and they were always quick to say so.”

while kathryn has always taken careful steps to shield herself from the spotlight, she did play a key role in slayer’s early eighties reputation as a group parents abhorred when she agreed to pose in an early band promotional photo as a bloodied, lingerie-clad corpse

“i was around 16 at the time,” she says. “jeff called me one evening and said they were about to do this photo shoot and that the girl they were going to use broke her toe and had to cancel, so he asked if i would fill in. and that i needed to bring some sort of black lingerie. i told him i had to get permission from my parents but that i’d be happy to do it. and since neither of us had driver’s licenses, tom came out and picked me up and we went to the garage at tom’s parents’ house, which is where they would rehearse, and we did the shoot. i was very shy and conservative in those days, but it was the least i could do. i was honored that they chose me.”

contrary to internet reports of them marrying in 1997, jeff and kathryn wed in las vegas in 1989 in a simple ceremony consisting of the happy heavy metal couple and the bride’s parents. the decision to marry wasn’t difficult for either jeff or kathryn, as they learned over a mid-afternoon breakfast at a local denny’s a few weeks before heading to vegas

“we ordered breakfast and we each ordered a beer, and jeff was just very quiet,” kathryn says. “i looked at him and just said, ‘i don’t know what you’re thinking—but whatever you ask me, i’ll say yes to.’ he waited, and then he looked up at me and said, ‘okay, let’s just fucking do it.’ and i said, ‘okay, let’s just fucking do what?’ and he said, ‘let’s just take off and get married.’ i said okay and asked him if he was sure, and he said, ‘yes, i’m sure. i marry you, i marry you for life.’ ”

hanneman’s official cause of death was alcohol-related cirrhosis, a result of a lifetime of drinking. “jeff was always a drinker,” says lombardo, who left the band (for the third time at least) earlier this year. “he always had a coors light tall can in his hand. always.”
“jeff and i always drank,” king adds. “they called steven tyler and joe perry the toxic twins. we were the drunk brothers.” he laughs. “the difference being that i don’t wake up in the morning and need a beer. jeff didn’t know how not to drink.”

“we partied and we partied hard,” says exodus founder—and current slayer touring guitarist—gary holt, who became friends with hanneman in the early eighties. “i have a million photos of us back in the day, just hanging out and drinking, beers in hand in the middle of the day at load-in.”

for kathryn, memories of jeff and her father bonding over martinis in the evening are still vivid. “about a year or so after we met, jeff moved in with me and my parents, and my dad would always love to come home and have a couple martinis. and he would offer jeff a drink and they would sit and have their martinis and play video games. so i have known jeff to drink from the day that i met him. i never really understood it, but drinking was always very much a part of jeff’s life.”

hanneman’s reliance on alcohol was obvious to anyone who spent enough time with him. however, he did manage to stay away from hard drugs for most of his life, except for a few years in the mid eighties when cocaine use became a common activity for jeff and tom

“you start making a little money, and the next thing you know, it’s there,” araya says. “it’s readily available and people are eager to provide it. after a weekend binge, you find yourself driving down the 405 at six in the morning—i’m driving, jeff’s feeding my nose, he’s feeding his nose. and you suddenly realize how easily this could have turned bad. i remember stopping, looking all around us—nobody else on the highway—and i looked at jeff and said, ‘man, this is fucking crazy. look at us. we can’t be doing this.’ and we stopped, threw what we had out the window and never touched it again. he stuck with his alcohol and i stuck with my ‘greenery,’ and we went about our existence

“we had our vices, but we didn’t let them control our lives like you see with a lot of other bands that are just starting out. that was the one thing that i thought was really cool about us—we didn’t let those things destroy us. we had control of ourselves to some extent.”

the extent to which hanneman had control of his alcohol intake became questionable in the mid nineties, when it started becoming more apparent to his wife and bandmates that jeff was no longer just a hard-partying goofball metalhead from l.a. but a serious adult drinker

“i would express my concern, and he would back off for a few months—but then he would go right back to drinking,” kathryn says. “a few years before his dad died in 2008, i did notice that jeff was relying on alcohol to start off his day. but i couldn’t say much at that point, because i just knew we’d wind up in a verbal confrontation about it. and i’m not going to say i didn’t drink with him—i did drink with him, sometimes quite heavily. i figured if i couldn’t beat him, join him. but eventually i realized that i couldn’t go on like that, and that if i stopped i might be able to help him get away from it too. but i couldn’t. he just relied on it too much to get him through the day.”

his bandmates are quick to point out that hanneman’s drinking rarely became an issue within the group, though it did creep in on occasion

“the only thing that comes to mind,” says king, “was when we were on the divine intervention tour [in 1994/95], when paul [bostaph] was with us, and we wanted to play ‘sex. murder. art.’ live. but on that album i pretty much played everything in the studio, so i don’t think jeff had ever played that song. and he was just too messed up all the time to learn it, so paul, tom and i just did it as a three-piece because jeff would not come onstage and play it. after that, we said, ‘listen dude, like it or not, you’re a part of this band, and if we decide to play a song, you gotta play that fucking song.’ ”

on the road, particularly in later years, jeff spent most of his time on the tour bus after gigs by himself, watching the history channel or reading a book about world war ii. “jeff was super intelligent about history—world war ii became his thing,” says king

hanneman, whose german-american father fought as an american soldier in world war ii and brought home medals from dead nazi soldiers that he gave to his son, was morbidly fascinated by the second world war and nazi germany, collecting dozens of german soldier action figures and naming his various dogs and cats after nazi officials and elements of wwii-era germany. his own wedding ring was a collectable replica of a skull-emblazoned band worn by high-ranking nazi official reinhard heydrich. while objects connected to this time in history are understandably offensive to many, to jeff they were just symbols of the same darkness that energizes metal’s imagery

“jeff wrote what he wrote,” says araya. “and people would analyze it and come up with their own conclusions—but to jeff it was just a song about this or that. there was no deep meaning behind anything. and a lot of the stuff he did, he knew that it would cause a reaction—he knew it would get a response. and if you’re going to make a big stink about it, that’s your problem—that was his attitude about it.”

as the “quiet one” in slayer, the guitarist never made socializing with fans a top priority

“he’d stay on the bus for a long time after a show,” araya says. “and then when the crowds would thin out and all the vips were gone—all the wannabes who were hanging out and partying—once they dissipated, he would make his way out and see who was still hanging out. there are people who want to hang out just because it’s cool, but jeff didn’t want to hang out with those people, so he would wait. if he didn’t like you, he wouldn’t hang with you.”

and when it came to sightseeing, “jeff pretty much only went to war museums, as you can imagine,” king says. “i remember the first time we went to moscow, maybe around 1998. his whole thing was going to one of the moscow war museums, so i was like, ‘hey, that sounds cool,’ so i went with him. and it was just windy and cold as fuck there. but jeff loved that stuff.”

for kathryn, who preferred to remain at home when jeff went on tour, all she could do was count the days until he returned. “it was extremely hard for me,” she says. “the first tour they did was a three-week tour from southern california up to san francisco, and in those days there were no cell phones or internet, and it was difficult for him to stay in touch with me. and at first i just thought, oh my god, i’m gonna die. when the band finally started touring europe, he made sure to send me letters and postcards almost every day, and that was the only thing that kept me going, because i really didn’t know when i would talk to him again.”

as the years wore on, returning home from tour usually meant the rest of the band had seen the last of hanneman for a while. “he would just go home and detach,” king says. “he might have lived only 45 minutes away, but unless you were part of his inner circle, it was hard to stay in touch with him. and it took me a few years to understand that. for a while i was just like, ‘why isn’t this guy calling me back?’ but as i got older i just realized that that was who jeff was

“i don’t think jeff and i were ever best friends,” continues king. “i think we were probably the closest in the band, but never best friends. to put it in a way that everyone could understand, jeff and i were like business partners. was he my friend? of course he was my friend. but we didn’t really act like that. the last time i was at jeff’s house was january 2003. we went to his place to watch the raiders in the playoffs. and it sounds horrible, but it wasn’t horrible. that was just how it was.”

“when jeff was home, jeff liked to be home and stay home,” kathryn says. “he was over it—over the road, over people, over everything. he just wanted to hibernate for a while, and i always respected that. when he was home he liked to sleep in and just kick back during the day. sometimes he’d get an idea for a song and run down to his music room and start working on music

and video games—jeff was a huge video game buff. it started around 1983 with intellivision, and after that it was sega and nintendo and everything else. if any new system came out, we went out and got it immediately. first-person shooters were his thing. he kept up to date on all of them

“the tv was always on seinfeld, frasier, cheers, scrubs. and of course football or hockey. sometimes all the tvs in the house would be on, and we’d be watching different games in every room.”

pets, football, seinfeld, video games, music—yes, home life for jeff and kathryn hanneman was almost surprisingly wholesome, particularly around the holidays

“christmas was his absolute favorite holiday,” kathryn says. “he loved giving gifts, and he would always get me quite a few gifts. he started me on a german nutcracker collection and a bear collection, so he was always buying me new pieces for those. for jeff, the bigger the tree, the better. our house has 24-foot-high cathedral ceilings, and i remember one year him coming home with a tree that was 22 feet high! [laughs] and of course i would be the one climbing up and down the ladder decorating it. jeff liked to just sit back and watch me decorate the tree.”

when it came to playing guitar and writing songs at home, jeff never had any kind of set structure. he would go long stretches without picking up a guitar when the band wasn’t active, and songwriting was done on the spur of the moment, whenever inspiration struck

“he would never ever say, ‘i need to go and write a song,’ ” kathryn says. “it would just hit him out of nowhere. he never planned it or was preoccupied with it. if we were at a restaurant, he would ask me if i had the recorder with me, and i’d pull it out and he’d basically hum the riff or speak the lyric into the recorder. and if we were home in the middle of watching tv, he’d get up and run down to the music room and start laying out the drums. that’s how many of his slayer songs came about.”

hanneman established himself as slayer’s principal songwriter early on. by the late eighties and early nineties, he had formed a close working relationship with araya, who handled lyrics for many of hanneman’s most iconic songs, including “south of heaven,” “war ensemble” and “seasons in the abyss.”

“we seemed to connect on ideas and themes,” araya says. “he would have an idea that was half-written, and i’d read it and work on it and disappear and put thoughts together and then i’d say, ‘what do you think?’ and he’d say, ‘this is great. this is exactly what i was hoping you’d come up with.’ he was very encouraging about me putting my ideas down and the two of us working together. i always liked working with jeff because he allowed me to do things that came naturally. there was a lot of freedom between the two of us when we wrote music and created songs. i think i’m really going to miss that

“of all the songs that we’ve ever written as a band, the two songs that ended up getting grammys—‘eyes of the insane’ and ‘final six’—were songs that jeff and i worked on together. that’s something i’m really proud of and something i always tried to make him proud of. i would say, ‘look, you wrote two grammy-winning songs. you can’t get any better than that. that’s a milestone.’ ”

lombardo, too, had great respect for hanneman as a songwriter and admired the fact that jeff would present his songs with a basic drum-machine beat already in place. “so many guitar players can’t program a drum machine or play along with their own songs,” says lombardo, who is currently performing and writing with his band, philm. “doing it the way he did takes a lot more talent because you’re thinking of all the instrumentation in a song rather than relying on other people. he heard everything in his mind before anyone else did

“the ‘vibey’ quality of jeff’s songs allowed me to create these crescendos and decrescendos, making the song dynamically louder or bringing it back down with the drums. his songs were never just a constant roar of guitar playing—they were dynamic, and it gave me the opportunity to decorate the songs a little more in a form that made sense.”

while news of hanneman’s death in may came as a shock to all but his closest friends and family—“was i surprised by how he died? no,” king says. “was it a surprise that it was that quick? yes.”—there were events that occurred in the previous few years that could be viewed as contributing factors in the guitarist’s downward spiral. one was the death of his father in 2008

“that’s when things really started to go downhill for him,” kathryn says. “it was probably the hardest thing he ever had to face in his entire life. when i met jeff he didn’t have all that great of a relationship with his father. but as time went on they became very close. so that took a toll on him. he was never quite the same after that. i just don’t think he cared anymore.”

it was also around this time that jeff was quietly battling an arthritic condition that had been progressing over many years and was now beginning to worsen to the point of interfering with his playing. “his ability to play was slowly deteriorating,” araya says, “but he didn’t let anybody know that. we could just tell that things were going wrong. it was becoming hard to get stuff out of him. he was very proud and didn’t want to make anyone worry about anything. jeff would show up and play, and he didn’t want anyone to know or worry about what else was going on with him. he tried to be really strong and sometimes that can weigh you down.”

“you would notice it in his hands and a little bit in his walk,” lombardo says. “it seemed like he was struggling with his playing—it wasn’t fluid. you could hear it in the leads. his playing just wasn’t as tight as it could have been.”

according to kathryn, uric acid buildup from alcohol consumption no doubt contributed to jeff’s arthritis, but there wasn’t much she could do about either problem that was plaguing the guitarist. “we took him to a specialist and got him diagnosed,” she says. “but as you can imagine, jeff didn’t want to deal with any medication to help the problem. jeff wasn’t a pill popper. when i would see him take an aleve, i would know that he was in extreme pain from the arthritis and the aleve would help him get through rehearsal or whatever he had to do. he dealt with that for many, many years

“doctors wanted him to stay away from three of his favorite things—beer, red meat and peanut butter—but jeff was going to do this his way, and he would just deal with the pain on his own terms.”

in january 2011, an incident occurred that many would later assume was the cause of his death but wasn’t. jeff was bitten on his right arm an insect that was carrying a flesh-eating disease called necrotizing fasciitis. reports circulated that it was a spider that bit jeff, but that was never confirmed. whatever bit him, it was enough send the guitarist’s life into a tailspin

“jeff had been visiting a friend in the l.a. area,” kathryn says. “he was in the jacuzzi one night relaxing, and he had his arm over the side, and he felt something, like a bite or a prick. but of course he didn’t think anything of it. he came home about a week later, and he was pretty well lit when he came through the front door. he wasn’t feeling well, and he just wanted to go upstairs and go to sleep. before he did he said, ‘kath, i need to show you something, even though i really don’t want to.’

"and he took off his shirt, and i just freaked out when i saw his arm. it was bright red and three times the normal size. i said, ‘jeff, we need to go now. we need to get you to the er.’ but all he wanted to do was go to bed and sleep, and i knew that i was trying to rationalize with a very intoxicated person. so there was nothing i could do that night. but the next morning i convinced him to let me take him in. he didn’t have a lot of strength, but i was able to get him into the car

“when we got to the hospital in loma linda, they took one look at him and they immediate knew what it was, so they took him right in. jeff told me to go home because we both knew he’d be there for hours and neither of us thought it would be a life-or-death situation. about three or four hours later, jeff called me and said, ‘kath, it’s not good. they may have to amputate. i think you need to come back here.’

"when i got there, jeff was on the stretcher waiting to go into surgery, and the doctor put it in perspective for me. he said, ‘i need you to see your husband. he may not make it.’ the doctor looked at jeff and told him, ‘first i’m going to try to save your life. then i’m going to try to save your arm. then i’m going to try to save your career.’ and looking at jeff on that stretcher and possibly saying goodbye, knowing that i may never see him again…”—she pauses—“…was one of the hardest moments of my life.”

the next few days for the hannemans could only be described as nerve-wracking. jeff was in the icu in an induced coma after the initial surgery and breathing through a tube, his arm, for the most part, intact. doctors attempted to remove the breathing tube at one point, but jeff was unable to breathe on his own. finally, after about the fourth day, the tube was removed and jeff was breathing again. her husband was alive, but as soon as they removed the bandages from jeff’s arm, kathryn knew the road to recovery would be long

“i’ll never forget it—i couldn’t believe what i was seeing,” she recalls. “all i could do was look up at the doctor and say, ‘how the hell do you fix this?’ and he said, ‘you know, mrs. hanneman, you’d be very surprised.’ and at that moment i had all the faith in the world that this doctor could fix his arm.”

back home soon afterward, jeff could begin the process of rehabilitating his arm in the hopes of regaining his ability to play guitar. the next few weeks saw more surgeries, staples and multiple grafts using skin from his left thigh. wound-care suction devices were on hand to draw out the infection and help the skin grafts take. physically, jeff’s arm was on the mend. emotionally, however, he was struggling. depression was setting in

“i couldn’t get jeff to go to rehab or therapy,” kathryn says. “i think he was letting the visual of his arm get to his emotions, and it was messing with his mind. it was hard to keep him upbeat at that point

“i think he thought he could do this on his own—that he would just to go rehearsal and play, and that that would be his rehab. but i think he started to learn, once he tried rehearsing, that he wasn’t playing up to his ability and that he wasn’t able to play guitar at the speed he was used to. and i think that really hit him hard, and he started to lose hope.”

the incident with jeff’s arm couldn’t have come at a worse time for the band. a european tour was booked for march and april 2011, and the legendary big 4 tour, which saw slayer sharing a stage with fellow thrash pioneers metallica, megadeth and anthrax, was on the schedule between april and september. these shows were immensely important for the band, but it was becoming increasingly obvious that jeff wouldn’t be able to participate

“for me it was really difficult to make the decision to go on without jeff,” araya says. “they started naming names to take his place, and i’m like, how can you guys even think about this? we can’t do this without jeff. but we had to do something. slayer, aside from being band members and really tight-knit, we are a business. those are aspects of what we do that fans have a tough time understanding. so we had to make decisions because we were obligated to do these tours.”

of all the possible replacements for hanneman being bandied about, everyone was most comfortable with exodus mainstay gary holt, a longtime friend of the band’s

“i remember when the tour came up, jeff said to me, ‘no. no. there’s no way in hell this band is going out without me,’ ” kathryn says. “he was definitely hurt by the fact that, for the first time ever, the band had to go on without him, but eventually he became okay with it, and a lot of that was because it was his friend gary that was going to fill in for him. he knew the band had to go on.”
“gary was a friend, he wasn’t an outsider,” araya says. “we’ve known him for 30 years and he was a good friend of jeff’s. when we first met exodus, he and jeff were inseparable.”

fans were hopeful that hanneman was well on his way to a full recovery when the guitarist joined his bandmates onstage for two songs—“angel of death” and “south of heaven”—at the big 4 show in indio, california, on april 23, 2011, four months after the bite on his arm. behind the scenes, however, a different story was emerging

“he wasn’t at his best that night, but he was able to come out and do those two songs,” araya says. “it was after that that i think he realized that he could only play for a little bit and then had to stop. he would come in to rehearse and he would jam out some parts and then he’d stop and just kind of fiddle with his guitar. he did that a few times, but then he just stop coming to rehearsal

“we told him, ‘listen, we understand that you’re having a tough time playing your guitar, having a tough time coming back 100 percent, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t be a part of what we do, which is write songs. you are still slayer, you are a big part of this band, you can still write music and you can still put ideas together. sit in the studio and work with us, make us what we are.’ he was a big part of this band. i knew it and realized it a long time ago.”

“we were holding out hope until the day he died,” king says. “if he ever came to us and said, ‘okay, i can do this,’ there was no question. this was his gig. now, did i think that would actually happen? no, i didn’t.”

“i think part of him knew that he wasn’t going to be back in the band,” kathryn adds

as the realism about his situation began to set in, jeff was forced to accept the fact that his livelihood was being stripped away, no doubt fueling his alcohol-induced decline over the next year and a half. factor in hanneman’s uncommunicative, reclusive nature, and there wasn’t much his bandmates could do but carry on

“people have to make their own decisions about how they want to live their lives,” araya says. “you can’t start dictating to people how they should live because it just pushes them away. it doesn’t help anything. it wasn’t easy but it’s not like we were blind to what was going on. we knew. and there were points that we tried to help and encourage him to come back—tell him he could still be a part of what we do, even if it wasn’t full time

“but i think a lot of it had to do with the fact that he didn’t want to let us down. he didn’t want to disappoint us. he was very prideful and wanted to make sure he could come back at 100 percent. i think when he was having real difficulty over that last year, he just didn’t want us to know about it. he kept saying that he needed more time. and the isolation didn’t help much either. i think that no matter how things would have worked out, the end result would have been the same.”

“it eats you up because you think, why can’t i fix this guy?” king says. “and it’s not that he didn’t want to be fixed. i mean, he didn’t want to die. but he also couldn’t help himself before it was too late.”

on may 2, 2013, the sudden news took the metal community by storm: jeff hanneman had died. araya recalls his final communications with his longtime friend and bandmate: “i had been texting with him, and he even sent me a song that he had been working on. so it seemed like he was doing okay. but when i got the call that he was back in intensive care, i became concerned. eventually he stopped responding to my texts. it was like a one-sided conversation

“i was home with my family when i found out he had died. the phone rang and my wife answered it, and she had this look of dread on her face. she handed me the phone and didn’t say anything, and it was our manager, rick [sales], and he told me. i hung up the phone and went to my room and i cried

“it hit my family hard, because they really liked jeff, they knew him really well. my mother was really upset, my sisters really loved jeff, and my brother too—he was jeff’s tech for a long time. everyone in my family knew him and loved him a lot.”

currently, the future of slayer is uncertain. upcoming short tours of europe and south america will go on as planned, but what happens after that is anyone’s guess

“i plan on continuing,” king says. “i don’t think we should throw in the towel just because jeff’s not here.”

as for lombardo, even though his split from the band a few months ago was publicly acrimonious, he says his door is open for any future discussions with his former bandmates. “if they want to talk, i’m here. i don’t want any kind of animosity between us. life is too short and we’re too old for that shit. i’m ready and willing, so we’ll see what happens.”

araya, on the other hand, has no idea what the future holds for this band. and it’s a decision he’s currently struggling with

“after 30 years, it would literally be like starting over,” he says. “to move forward without jeff just wouldn’t be the same, and i’m not sure the fans would be so accepting of that drastic a change. especially when you consider how much he contributed to the band musically. and you can have someone sit in for him, but there’s no one on this planet that can do what jeff did

losing all grasp an evil so old
vengeance it breeds driving you insane
exhaust all will hanging by the neck
anguish within let it blind the eyes
better off dead is your epitaph
apathy feeds the human demise

[verse 3]
absolute reign a malevolent mind
conceptions so vile in this bottomless soul
shooting up hate nothing beats the rush
total addicting, corrupt and profane
force-fed lies in this chapel of lust
dancing in blood disciples enslaved
putrefied walls adorned with your flesh
coating this shrine of the ungodly cross

[chorus]
you love to hate me
but you won't kill me
suicidal surge
desensitize the world

[lead: king]

[verse 4]
enter my mind can you stop the rage
no one shall mourn or pity my grave
fighting the world without remorse
searching for blood to never grow old
absolute reign a malevolent mind
conceptions so vile in this bottomless soul
putrefied walls adorned with your flesh
coating this shrine of the ungodly cross

[chorus]
you love to hate me
but you won't kill me
suicidal surge
desensitize the world it's the terror that you've gotta miss
and i wanna see you right in front of death
your eyes will shine
we're all alone and there is no noise

step into my shadow
with no remorse

with no remorse you ain't gotta die
the loudest noise can't make me happy
come on, bastards, feels so good
the record's coming out, baby

with no remorse i want to die

no remorse
with no remorse i wanna die

"remain calm, i'm coming to your house to kill you"

i can't come down

no remorse
with no remorse i wanna die

what you want me to do?
what you want me to do?

no remorse 'cause i wanna die

no remorse
with no remorse i wanna die [verse 1]
terrorize, frozen eyes stare deep in me
paralyzed inside, death breeds on your pain
pretty lace lie in hate, you wear my scars
terrified, you find that you push me too far
your repulsiveness reminds me of dead flesh
rotting corpse the smell of your putrid fucking soul

[bridge]
petrified that i decide the moment of your death
belongs to me, the taste is sweet, it's so unreal
your god weeps, it bleeds, it begs for me
god is letting you recover

[lead - hanneman]

[chorus 1]
welcome to my black serenade
the entrance to my hell, your pain
scream your song, the black serenade
live in fear, a mind insane

[verse 2]
voice inside my head
your face still shows itself to me
telling me you're dead
staring at your lifeless body
i saw you fucking die
my mind's tearing itself apart
screaming from the inside
release this pain from my fucking heart

[verse 3]
destroy the empty shell
smash away the haunting fear
i hate your endless stare
watching as i fuck your corpse

[chorus 2]
welcome to my black serenade
the entrance of my hell, your pain
walk through a tortured mind
you'll scream your song in time

[verse 1]
i need to redefine
all the things i hate today
politics that fail
from a president derailed
i hate the shit economy
it might as well be sodomy
i know that in the end
i'm expected to pretend

[pre-chorus]
but i can't relate
to your verbal idiocy
no one's in control
when the government's the enemy

[lead - king]

[chorus]
so light the fuse
impose your views
consfearacy
is anarchy

[post-chorus]
actions of hostility
breeds conformity
annihilation will begin
extermination from within

[chorus]
so light the fuse
impose your views
consfearacy
is anarchy

[lead - king]

[verse 2]
i need to redefine
how i see the world today
seems that all the war
didn't even up the score
it's only mind pollution
there is no resolution
still i know that in the end
i'm expected to pretend
that i can't think for myself
blame it all on someone else
half-hearted smile
while you look the other way

[pre-chorus]
i can't relate
to your verbal idiocy
no one's in control
when the government's the enemy

[chorus]
so light the fuse
impose your views
consfearacy
complacency is your demise [verse 1]
i won't cover your eyes
i want your innocence
glisten before me in a cold sweat
i wan't you to see your lie spill on me
spill on me

[pre-chorus 1]
manifested as a primitive craving
the craving never seems to go away
i want to see the face of everyone fall
fall into the cold embrace of death

[chorus 1]
you're in my nightmare
i decide when it stops
it's my fucking drug
makes my rush intensify
hardcore, the overdose
your fear gets me high

[verse 2]
unbound, i'm the weapon made to sterilize
sterilize all the idiot victims
anytime, anywhere, anyone i want
everyone's addicted to this torture

[pre-chorus 2]
i'm the agony in every breath
every breath brings you closer to me
you'll do anything, anything
you'll do anything to make it stop

[chorus 2]
you're in my nightmare
i decide when it stops
it's my fucking drug
makes my rush intensify
chaos deep inside, it makes me

[bridge]
it makes me feel surreal
it makes me need to kill
it makes me feel surreal
it makes me need to kill

[verse 3]
do you want to feel eternity?
your eternity lies within me
i am the terror of your final breath
your final breath brings light to my darkness

[pre-chorus 3]
like an act of fucking god unleashed
on the innocence, innocence of mankind
you'll do anything, anything
you'll do anything to make it stop

[chorus 3]
it's my fucking drug
makes my rush intensify
hardcore fucking overdose
your fear gets me off like fuck

[outro]
it makes me feel surreal
it makes me need to kill

needles stabbed into the walls
the executioners curtain call
fighting back he found his identity
and there was no way out

cause richard hung himself
richard hung himself
it happened just the other day
jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
he thought he find a better way
with slashing, and stabbing, and maiming and ramming

death threw his black curtains
where his clothes once lied
the roof kicked out and the rope tied to the rafters
a quick kick of the chair
and it was all through
if richie only knew

cause richard hung himself
richard hung himself
it happened just the other day
jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
he thought he find a better way
with needles, injecting and shooting subcutaneously

his life suddenly flashed right before his eyes
what a swinging guy
turning gray with mold
this is when he died

give it up [x2]
throw it all away

burning acid bath
pulmonary wrath
feel the boiling surge
it won't let you go

throw it all away [2x]
throw it all a....... [2x]
throw it all away

swinging in his room
richie won't come out to play
that poor bastard hung himself the other day
oh how the years seem to fly by
is death the final high

'cause richard hung himself
richard hung himself
it happened just the other day
jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
he thought he find a better way
with slashing and stabbing and ripping
and stabbing and shredding and slashing
and shredding and stabbing and ripping
and tearing attacking and maiming
and taking the body that god gave to you

i gotta get out

'cause richard hung himself ('cause richard hung himself)
'cause richard swung himself ('cause richard hung himself)
'cause richard strung himself ('cause richard hung himself)
the needle, it stung itself ('cause richard hung himself)
they pulled him right off the fucking shelf ('cause richard hung himself)
that poor bastard, man he hung himself ('cause richard hung himself)

to fucking think of himself can't explain the other side
answers lost before their eyes
violence surges from inside
a state of mind that never dies
born into a chosen way
life that doesn't fit today
to die a painful death it seems
is better than your misery
contemplating rearranging
changing all your ways of thinking

everyday you life seems like
it's pushed into a hole
acting out another's needs
to rule a soul eternally
adjusting to another set
of values takes it's toll
growing in a lunacy
that plays on your stupidity

circle of beliefs
secrets never keep
living in a lie
right before your eyes
born without a brain
helpless is your name
all you do is pray
living is your pain

mentally so small you can't
accept another side
your point of view a memory
because it doesn't mean a thing
the resurrection's waiting for
a world without sin
the temples will crumble
while awaiting for it to begin

circle of beliefs
secrets never keep
living in a lie
right before your eyes
losing is your way
mental disarray
i can see your strain
you don't want to be saved

[lead: king]

can't you see no validity
must control silencing of souls
slow decay spreading through your brain
devastate the deviant will dominate

can't you see there's no validity
your way is not the only way
slow decay spreading through your brain
don't you see the power of the enemy
tyrants total supremacy
control the silencing of souls
slavery within the entity
devastate, dominate

can't explain the reason why
someone would rather live than die
if dying is the only way
to end a life of mental stains
all your life he's been the cause
a man impaled upon a cross
pure religious holocaust
if religion dies it's not my loss

[lead: hannemann]
perception always biased feeding off a fallacy
your systematic way of life
decided for you every night
intentional conflicting words
avoid solidity
blinded by the holy light
that constantly consumes your mind

circle of beliefs
secrets never keep
living in a lie
right before your eyes
burning in my wake
souls are free to take
you're following a fake
everyone awake!!! [(hanneman) pennemunde music ascap]

can't stand -

we'll fight - yeah

do i think you'll win - no

do i think you're stupid - yeah
do i think you're lame - yeah
am i stressing
you're the one to blame

[repeat intro.]

i open my mouth at the wrong time
always ranking on somebody
i'm drunk all the time
throwing beer bottles and spitting in your face
checking through the purse
of the slut in our place

she'll never notice if her money is gone
piss in her jacket
and just send her along

[repeat intro.] unknown are the caverns of the mind
new realms of affliction lurk inside
unbound massive mental energy
your last breaths taken from you easily

incoherence disrupts your rationale
involuntary your last confessional
no sense of being missing segments of time
inconsistency is feeding on your mind

[lead: hannemann]

mind control, pain unfolds
i own all your sensations
weakening, reasoning
mesmeric full demolition
hypnotized - victimized
behold the threshold to the web
screaming souls fear echoes
piercing boundaries of the dead

[lead: king]

penetration of the window to your soul
deterioration of the mind, no self control
temporarily comprehend no memories
hollow carcass of a man is all i leave

execution but a thought in the end
slowly erasing your life and what has been
passing victims in the land of secrecy
cerebral death can come to you in your dreams anarchy, disarray this is the world today
justice is a lie for the followers to get by
no peace, only guns, can't trust anyone
live or die it's an eye for an eye

unrest, martial law, society decays
and it's safe to say there is no other way
with lawless arrogance and savage dissidents
public display of dismemberment

blameless innocent, lies of the decadent
brazen hypocrites answering to idiots
new tax, market crash, high life never lasts
no quick fix, for broken politics

unrest, martial law, society decays
and it's safe to say there is no other way
with lawless arrogance and savage dissidents
public display of dismemberment

aftermath of tolerance judgment is defined
individual pain is a strong incentive
infiltrate with fear keeping penance ever near

bleeding my ideology through pain

i'll re-instate
don't cross my path

you've pushed too far
my secrets i defend

demonize what is feared profane architect
skull and bones through the mind
barbaric thoughts of old
celebrate all unknown
at last the dead await
the die is cast for the meek
inherit endless dead time
smell the victims are near
consume the catalyst
hunting masses for game
implanting septic thoughts
reaping terror through words while
armed behind your back
pseudo leaders betray
enslaving all of mankind
cast out the demigod
dethrone the demagogue
cast out the church of god

[outro]
i command your life
and i don't care
let bullets rain

no suicide

no one will ever cross my love
deadly consequence will rise above

watch the blanket search the ground
you will die on your knees
by the hand of mr. freeze

horror awaits for those who evade
ice cold blood, stops in their veins

arm yourselves to the "t"
repel the threat of mr. freeze
see the blood drop in your eyes
see your family burned alive

i don't even know you
i just know where you live
i've raided your child's bedroom
burned his virgin skin
i'd crucify your nation
i'll leave your dead to rot
i'll praise your damaged street
and bear an iron cross

the oceans have been ripped away
it does no good to pray
all todays cataclysm
men restore to cannibalism

i'm worth all you'd care for
then i'll fuck you in the ass
oh so fucking happy
as i kick your face and laugh
today's war stories
at night i can hear you scream
there's blood on your pillow
this is no bad dream

and all you can do is scream! [eric "joie" mastrokolas / brett dodwell / roy hansen]

an easy mark for a veteran of execution

embraced immoral passion
born is still, thirst for thrill
indulgence of illusion
neurotic, psychotic
dead silent screams, come alive

killing seed, first degree
i shut the world outside
denied and laid to waste
the body and soul divide

a final thrill, a timely kill
unbound, unguarded
fantasized, realized
enforced upon the dying
free reign of the asylum
archaic energy thrives
dead cold, i control
eternal screams that slowly die

killing spree, first degree
i shut the world outside
denied and laid to waste
the body and soul divide

dementia born of sin
a symptom that begins
vengeance so divine

lost my grip of what's real
unrestrained self-induced vertigo
manic power chills my spine
i can't erase this instinct i embrace

two faced moral abandon
races my blood boils my skin
unhinging the doorway to this asylum
releasing unshackled poison dreams
beginning the end of temptation
a vengeance so divine
the end of temptation
a vengeance so divine

trident missiles in the air
my missiles underground

a bomber flying off their ramps
nuclear bombs explode

radio active people

mass starvation
contaminated water
destroyed cities
mutilated bodies

memories of tomorrow (crying sorrow)

you'd know why

memories of tomorrow get your motor running
head out on the highway
looking for adventure
and whatever comes our way
ya darling you could make it happen
leave the world in a dull disgrace
fire all of your guns and once in
explode into space
i like smoke and lightning
heavy metal thunder
racing with the wind
and the feeling that i'm under
ya darling you could make it happen
leave the world in a dull disgrace
fire all of your guns and once in
explode into space
'cause you're a true nature child
we were born, born to be wild
we can climb so high
i never want to die
born to be wild

reality's black drape!
colours in your mind!
satisfy your time!

[chorus]
oh, you, you know you must be blind
to do such things like this
to take the sweet that you don't know
you're giving death a kiss, poor little fool now
your mind is full of pleasure
your body's looking ill
to you, it's shallow leisure
so drop the acid pill, don't stop to think now

[bridge]
you're having a good time, baby, but that won't last
your mind's all full of things, you're living too fast
go out, enjoy yourself, don't bottle it in
you need someone to help you stick the needle in, yeah

[guitar solo]

[verse 3]
now, you know the scene
your skin starts turning green
your eyes no longer seeing
life's reality
push the needle in!
face death's sickly grin!
holes are in your skin
caused by deadly pin!

[verse 4]
head starts spinning 'round
you fall down to the ground
feel your body heave
death's hand starts to weave
it's too late to turn!
you don't wanna learn!
price of life is high!
now, you're gonna die! come hear the moon is calling
the witching hour draws near
come hear the bell is tolling
mortals run in fear
prepare the altar now and hear the virgin cry
hold fast the sacrafice
for now it's the time to die
all hell breaks loose
hell's breaking loose

unveil the pentagram
and feel the demons lust
come watch the holy men
who look on in disgust
come taste blood
and feel the heat of satan's breath
look in the sky's and see
the warriors of death
all hell breaks loose
hell's breaking loose
witching hour

our work is now complete
the blood runs fast and free
and satan takes his bride
and cry's of blasphemy
all hell rejoices at the child
that she will bear
and satans only son
shall be the worlds despair
all hell breaks loose
hell's breaking loose

you think the world will end today
you praise the lord, that's all you say

jesus saves
listen to you pray
you think you'll see the pearly gates when death takes you away

for all respect, you cannot lust
in an invisible man you place your trust
indirect dependency
eternal attempt at amnesty
he will decide who lives and dies
depopulate, satanic rise
you will be an accessory
irreverence and blasphemy

jesus saves
no need to pray, the gates of pearl have turned to gold
it seems you've lost your way




jesus saves
no words of praise, no promised land to take you to
there is no other way [verse 1]
blasting our way through the boundaries of hell
no one can stop us tonight
we take on the world with hatred inside
mayhem the reason we fight
surviving the slaughters and killing we've lost
then we return from the dead
attacking once more now with twice as much strength
we conquer then move on ahead

guides us with every first step

soon there'll be nothingness left
midnight has come and the leathers strapped on
evil is at our command
we clash with god's angel and conquer new souls
consuming all that we can

to witness such a violent show
of power overthrown

angels fighting aimlessly
still dying by the sword
our legions killing all in sight
to get the one called lord

the gates of hell lie waiting as you see
there's no price to pay, just follow me
i can take your lost soul from the grave
jesus knows your soul can not be saved

crucify your so-called "lord"
he soon shall fall to me
your souls are damned, your god has fell
to slave for me eternally
hell awaits...

the reaper guards the darkened gates
that satan calls his home
demons feed the furnace where
the dead are free to roam




lonely children of the night
there's seven ways to go
each leading to the burning hole
that lucifer controls

priests of hades seek the sacred star
satan sees the answer lies not far
zombies screaming souls cry out to you
satanic laws prevail your life is through

pray to the moon... when it is round
death with you shall then abound
what you seek for can't be found
in sea or sky or underground

[lead - hanneman]

now i have you deep inside my everlasting grasp
the seven bloody gates of hell
is where you'll live your last

warriors from hell's domain
will bring you to your death
the flames of hades burning strong
your soul shall never rest




the gates of hell lie waiting as you see
there's no price to pay just follow me
i can take your lost soul from the grave
jesus knows your soul can not be saved

sacrifice the lives of all
i know they soon shall die
their souls are damned to rot in hell
and keep the fires growing deep inside
hell awaits...

die by the sword

satan watches all of us
smiles as some do his bidding
try to escape the grasp of my hand

compelled to live your sheltered lives
not once has anyone ever seen
such a rise of pure hypocrisy

i'll show you what i've known all this time

god hates us all, god hates us all
you know it's true god hates this place
you know it's true he hates this race

homicide-suicide
hate heals, you should try it sometime
strive for peace with acts of war
the beauty of death we all adore
i have no faith distracting me
i know why your prayers will never be answered

god hates us all; god hates us all
he fuckin' hates me

pessimist, terrorist targeting the next mark
global chaos feeding on hysteria
cut throat, slit your wrist, shoot you in the back fair game
drug abuse, self abuse searching for the next high
sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time
i'm waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies

i never said i wanted to be god's disciple
i'll never be the one to blindly follow

man made virus infecting the world
self-destruct human time bomb
what if there is no god would you think the fuckin' same
wasting your life in a leap of blind faith
wake the fuck up can't ignore what i say
i got my own philosophy

i hate everyone equally
you can't tear that out of me
no segregation -separation
just me in my world of enemies

i never said i wanted to be god's disciple
i'll never be the one to blindly follow
i'll never be the one to bear the cross-disciple

i reject this fuckin' race
i despise this fuckin' place [intro]
how i've waited for you to come
i've been here all alone
now that you've arrived
please stay awhile
and i promise i won't keep you long
i'll keep you forever...forever...forever...

funeral held for the depression of man
holds the key to his own death
entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
tighten the tourniquet around your neck
sifting away the debris of hated life
cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
seeking life beyond your perishment
repeating words echoing through your mind

chanting lines of blind witchery
to save yourself from extinction
wanting to die is your reason to live
new life born from the oppressed
taste your blood as it trickles through the air
another casualty beyond the shadows you fall
losing ground, the fate you feel draws near
fatality, reality, await the final call

[instrumental break]

my sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity
vessels in my brain carrying death until my birth
come and die with me forever, share insanity

do you wanna die?!

the waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies
turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind
non-rising body from the grave showing new reality
what i am, what i want, i’m only after death

hide your infinite tears inside, it seeks your smallest break
screaming as if nothing helps, you press on to survive
playing out the fantasies of a force that keeps you alive

i'll have you down on your knees

crucify your so-called "lord"
he soon shall fall to me
your souls are damned, your god has fell
to slave for me eternally
hell awaits...

the reaper guards the darkened gates
that satan calls his home
demons feed the furnace where
the dead are free to roam

lonely children of the night
there's seven ways to go
each leading to the burning hole
that lucifer controls

priests of hades seek the sacred star
satan sees the answer lies not far
zombies screaming souls cry out to you
satanic laws prevail your life is through

pray to the moon... when it is round
death with you shall then abound
what you seek for can't be found
in sea or sky or underground

[lead - hanneman]

now i have you deep inside my everlasting grasp
the seven bloody gates of hell
is where you'll live your last

warriors from hell's domain
will bring you to your death
the flames of hades burning strong
your soul shall never rest

the gates of hell lie waiting as you see
there's no price to pay just follow me
i can take your lost soul from the grave
jesus knows your soul can not be saved

sacrifice the lives of all
i know they soon shall die
their souls are damned to rot in hell
and keep the fires growing deep inside
hell awaits...

[lead - king] [instrumental intro]

cursed black magic night
we've been struck down
down in this hell

spells surround me day and night
stricken by the force of evil light
the force of evil light

cast under his spell
blinding my eyes
twisting my mind

fight to resist the evil inside
captive of a force of satan's might
a force of satan's might

fighting the curse
break it, i must
laughing in sorrow
crying in lust

[instrumental break]

my strength slips fast, soon i must fall
victim of fortune, my sources grow small
life slips away as demons come forth
death takes my hand and captures my soul




[instrumental outro] [intro]
aaah!!

[verse 1]
auschwitz, the meaning of pain
the way that i want you to die
slow death, immense decay
showers that cleanse you of your life
forced in like cattle
you run
stripped of
your life's worth
human mice, for the angel of death
four hundred thousand more to die

[chorus 1]
angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead

[verse 2]
sadistic, surgeon of demise
sadist of the noblest blood
destroying, without mercy
to benefit the aryan race
surgery, with no anesthesia
feel the knife pierce you intensely
inferior, no use to mankind
strapped down screaming out to die

[chorus 2]
angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead
infamous butcher
angel of death

[verse 3]
pumped with fluid, inside your brain
pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
burning flesh drips away
test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
frigid cold cracks your limbs
how long can you last
in this frozen water burial?
sewn together, joining heads
just a matter of time
'til you rip yourselves apart
millions laid out in their
crowded tombs
sickening ways to achieve
the holocaust

[verse 4]
seas of blood, bury life
smell your death as it burns
deep inside of you
abacinate, eyes that bleed
praying for the end of
your wide awake nightmare
wings of pain, reach out for you
his face of death staring down
your blood running cold
injecting cells, dying eyes
feeding on the screams of
the mutants he's creating
pathetic harmless victims
left to die
rancid angel of death
flying free

[guitar solo]

[chorus 2]
angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead
infamous butcher
angel of death
angel of death [verse 1]
harlots of hell spread your wings
as i penetrate your soul
feel the fire shoot through your body
as i slip into your throne
cast aside, do as you will
i care not how you plead
satan's child now stalks the earth
born from my demon seed

[chorus]
hot wings of hell
burns in my wake
death is what you pray
behold captor of sin

[verse 2]
infernal slaves of manipulation
captive of my vice
abandon god the helpless one
to relieve you of your plight
subversive action will not help
it will strengthen me
i see decline your every move
death your final plea




[chorus]
hot wings of hell
burns in my wake
death is what you pray
behold captor of sin

[bridge]
your skin turns to leather
i ignite your timid blood
you feel my lethal touch
as i grasp your weary soul
i'll take you down into the fire

[verse 3]
harlots of hell spread your wings
as i penetrate your soul
feel the fire shoot through your body
as i slip into your throne
cast aside, do as you will
i care not how you plead
satan's child now stalks the earth
born from my demon seed

[chorus]
hot wings of hell
burns in my wake
death is what you pray
behold captor of sin [verse 1]
screams and nightmares
of a life i want
can't see living this lie no
a world i haunt
you've lost all control of my
heart and soul
satan holds my future
watch it unfold

[chorus 1]
i am the antichrist
it's what i was meant to be
your god left me behind
and set my soul to be free

[verse 2]
watching disciples
of the satanic rule
pentagram of blood
holds the jackal's truth
searching for the answer
christ hasn't come
awaiting the final moment
the birth of satan's son




[bridge]
screams
from a life i live
torment
is what i give
torture
is what i love
the downfall
of heavens above

[chorus 2]
i am the antichrist
all love is lost
insanity is what i am
eternally my soul will rot (rot... rot) [instrumental] high velocity bullet at close range
can damage the mind
shattering the skull, shredding the brain
severing the spine
bury a round of lead in the chest
it's quite an impression
imagine the innards of your soul
the infliction

instinctive regression
with intent to kill
no regard of human life
or the blood spilled

riddled convulsions
confetti of flesh
scattered helplessly
losing your control of physical facilities
release the slide to cleanse inside
prepare to anoint
snap the tongue in the groove discharge
to make my hallowed point

instinctive regression
with intent to kill
no regard of human life
or the blood spilled

power of a gun
used with conviction
dispersed on excursions
randomly kills its victims
my sweet revenge
bitter in depression
the thrilling release
of a hatred deep persuasion

power of a gun
used with conviction
diffused compulsions
unending repercussions
violent emotion
screaming revulsion
spasmic convulsions
death an empty gun [verse 1]
i had you back, but it's no use
false accusations are on the loose
you know what? it makes no sense that you tied your own noose
you never felt the sores decay
your perfect world is ending today
so what? i wouldn't have it any other way

[instrumental]

[pre-chorus 1]
is this your paradise? you think you thought this through?
cause when you rolled the dice, the house came down on you
don't care what you do or say, your suicide begins today
have fun in paradise, this hell is just for you

[chorus 1]
you against you
shitty time to make a stand all without a master plan, just you
you against you

[verse 2]
so how's your paradise? hindsight just laughs at you
with conflict comes a price, that price weighs heaviest on you
i guess i should say thanks, dissension in the ranks
you panic lit the fuel; now it's you against you

[chorus 2]
you against you
wasn't looking for a fight, but i'm showing up tonight
shitty time to make a stand all without a master plan, just you
you against you

[instrumental]

[verse 3]
the seeds are what you've sown
never should have lit that fuse
enjoy your paradise
this hell is just for you

[chorus 2]

[instrumental] [intro]
how i've waited for you to come
i've been here all alone
now that you've arrived
please stay awhile
and i promise i won't keep you long
i'll keep you forever...forever...forever...

[verse 1]
graze the skin with my fingertips
the brush of dead cold flesh appease the means
provoking images delicate features so smooth
a pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon

[chorus]
dance with the dead in my dreams
listen to their hallowed screams
the dead have taken my soul
temptation's lost all control

[verse 2]
simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
lose all mind control, rationale declines
empty eyes enslave the creations
of placid faces and lifeless pageants!

in the depths of a mind insane
fantasy and reality are the same!

[solo]

[verse 3]
graze the skin with my fingertips
the brush of dead warm flesh pacifies the means
incised members ornaments on my being
adulating the skin before me

[verse 2]
simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
lose all mind control, rationale declines
empty eyes enslave the creations
of placid faces and lifeless pageants!

[chorus]
dance with the dead in my dreams
listen to their hallowed screams
the dead have taken my soul
temptation's lost all control
dance with the dead in my dreams
listen to their hallowed screams
the dead have taken my soul
temptation's lost all control

[outro (young woman's voice)]
hello?
hello mr. gein?
mr. gein?
let me outta here mr. gein
mr. gein?
i don't wanna play anymore mr. gein
mr. gein this isn't fun anymore i don't wanna play anymore mr. gein
mr. gein?
i want out of here mr. gein!
let me out now! mortuaries, dead of night
my body starts to rise
in my mind the horror lives
to feel death deep inside

relentless lust of rotting flesh
to thrash the tomb she lies
heathen whore of satan's wrath
i spit at your demise

virgin child now drained of life
your soul cannot be free
not given the chance to rot in hell

satan's cross points to hell
the earth i must uncover
a passion grows to feast upon
the frozen blood inside her

i feel the urge the growing need
to fuck this sinful corpse
my task's complete, the bitch's soul
lies raped in demonic lust




[lead - king]

her stomach bursts the casket breaks
the seed has taken form
a writhing shape of twisted flesh
the devil's child is thrown

hungry for the smell of death
he rules forbidden evil
vengeance with a frenzied hatred
the bastard now must die

lost souls of the dead
form legions that burst through hell's gates
death of one sacrifice
to avenge the raped corpse from the grave
blood of one mortal man
the fire grows stronger within
fate of a frenzied lust
lucifer takes my dark soul

down to the fiery pits of hell
(down to the fiery pits of hell)

[lead - hanneman] [verse 1]
when war cries echoing all begin
never know any other way to fight, just win
blood of the enemy when penance is due
you know that sacrifice starts with you!

[chorus]
cast the first stone
stand in my way
it's vengeance you owe
with blood, you will pay!

[verse 2]
i live for battle the intensity knows no peer
your defiance will prove severe
choking on blood, beaten in pain
realizing the fighting is all in vain

[chorus]
cast the first stone
stand in my way
it's vengeance you owe
with blood, you will pay!

when war cries echo sacrifice is you!

[instrumental]

[verse 3]
can feel that sweeping everywhere i walk?
like a devastating fire every time i talk!
man infested component you can't stop
a block of granite on my shoulder you can't knock off!

[chorus]
cast the first stone
stand in my way
it's vengeance you owe
with blood, you will pay! [verse 1]
through the night we rise in pairs
lords at night we ride
from the depths of hell's domain
reborn to reign this night
roam throughout the endless wars
hold high his name we must
warriors from the gates of hell
in lord satan we trust

[chorus]
stalking the night, can't you feel i'm near
watching each step that you take
i take lives and show all no mercy this night
attack those not knowing their fate

[verse 2]
brothers of the prince of night
by bargains we have made
allies with the darkened souls
our legions we must save
fight for our eternal quest
god can't save you in time
evil stalks the night with us
your soul, it shall be mine




[chorus]
stalking the night, can't you feel i'm near
watching each step that you take
i take lives and show all no mercy this night
attack those not knowing my force

[bridge]
i am the menace in your eyes
the one you can't escape
your life falls in my grasp
you know your end is near

you pray your god will help
his strength no match for mine
your last hope slips away
thy soul begins to bleed

i tear your flesh to shreds
burn holes throughout your mind
your eyes now filled with blood
a victim of my force

in endless agony
you realize your defeat
recite my master's chants
your soul now his to keep




[chorus]
stalking the night, can't you feel i'm near
watching each step that you take
i take lives and show all no mercy this night
attack those not knowing their fate frantic minds are terrified
life lies in a grave
silent death rides high above
on the wings of revelation
multi-death from chemicals
arrogance has won
annihilation must be swift
destroy without destruction

[chorus]
gods of the throne must be watching from hell
awaiting the mass genocide
soldiers defeated by death from a smell
bodies lie dormant no life
rising new souls on the land where they fell
demons not ready to die
nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie
chemical warfare

artificial fucking peace
line up in a death row
generals in their slow defeat
diminish from this hell
banished from the dying world
the lords of hell await
dogs of war are helpless prey
to immortality




[chorus]

liquidate
the torture kills the troops that try to fight
terminate
human pesticide bring days of doom
mist falls
the deadly gas that brings them to their knees
sacrifice
steal the soul and send his corpse to hell

mummified regions lying in dust
fall victim to this game
petrified corpses bathing in rust
taken without being blamed
falsified spirits farther they fall
soon they will join us in hell
see the sky burning the gates are ablaze
satan waits eager to merge [verse 1: tom araya]
propaganda death ensemble, burial to be
corpses rotting through the night, in blood laced misery

infiltration push reserves, encircle the front lines
supreme art of strategy, playing on the minds
bombard till submission, take all to their graves

your time slips away

raining blood
from a lacerated sky
bleeding its horror
creating my structure
now i shall reign in blood




[breakdown] [intro]
an unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
unsuspecting victims no warnings no signs
judgment day the second coming arrives
before you see the light you must die

[verse 1]
forgotten children conform a new faith
avidity and lust controlled by hate
the never ending search for your shattered sanity
souls of damnation in their own reality

[pre-chorus]
chaos rampant
an age of distrust
confrontations
impulsive habitat

bastard sons begat your cunting daughters
promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers
ingrate souls condemned for all eternity
obtained by immoral observance a domineering deity

impulsive sabbath

the root of all evil is the heart of a black soul
a force that has lived all eternity
the never ending search for a truth never told
the loss of all hope and your dignity

my face of pleasure the gleam in my eye

you're nothing
an object of animation
a subjective mannequin
beaten into submission
raping again and again

shackled

dangling in distress

my sole purpose never ends
bleeding

my satisfaction is what i need
the urge
to take my fist

you're nothing
an object of animation
a subjective mannequin
beaten into submission
raping again and again

slaves to my torment
scream to your heart's content
time and time again
pleasure in inflicting pain
power so insane
trying to circumvent
unadulterated battery
manipulated reality

bodies lay lifeless like dolls
a moment that felt like days
lives extinguished in a rage

so nauseous i don't realize
incessantly feeding the flies
in the moment of visceral haze
the last thing you see are my crazed eyes
the last thing you see are my eyes

fear lies beneath your facade
in panic you scream for your god
no way i’ll ever abstain
blood falls from the ceiling like rain

patiently unleash my violence
ingesting the sweet sound of your silence
in darkness this feeling i love
to be covered in blood... blood from above

this violence finally sets me free
brings demons back to torture me
there's no god pulling at my strings
i'm above all sorrow faith can bring

disengaged i see your face
an adrenaline rush i can’t replace
hands around your neck
your senses numb
staring into your eyes when the stillness comes [verse 1: slayer]
razors edge
outlines the dead
incisions in my head
anticipation the stimulation
to kill the exhilaration

[chorus 1: slayer]
close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die

[chorus 2: slayer]
close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane

desecrated eviscerated
time's perpetuated

inert flesh
a bloody tomb

an execution a sadist ritual
mad intervals of mind residuals

step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die

[chorus 2: slayer]
close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane waiting the hour destined to die
here on the table of hell
a figure in white unknown by man
approaching the altar of death
high priest awaiting dagger in hand
spilling the pure virgin blood
satan's slaughter, ceremonial death
answer his every command

death will come easy just close your eyes
dream of the friends you'll see
heavenly failure losing again
move on to a new form of life

altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned
confronting the evil you dread
coalesce into one your shadow and soul
soon you will meet the undead

altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned
confronting the evil you dread
coalesce into one your shadow and soul
soon you will meet the undead

enter to the realm of satan!




blood turning black, the change has begun
feeling the hatred of all damned in hell
flesh starts to burn, twist and deform
eyes dripping blood realization of death
transforming of five toes to two
learn the sacred words of praise, hail satan

a gift of powers disposed upon you
use them when you feel the need
master the forces and powers of satan
controlling the creature's instinct
drawn to the castles that float in the sky
learn to resist the temptation
watching the angels sift through the heavens
endlessly searching for salvation frantic minds are terrified

a child's toy sudden death
sniper blazes you through your knees
falling down can you feel the heat

ambushed by the spray of lead
count the bullet holes in your head
offspring sent out to cry
living mandatory suicide

lying, dying, screaming in pain
begging, pleading, bullets drop like rain
mines explode, pain sheers through your brain
radical amputation, this is insane




fly swatter stakes drive through your chest
spikes impale you as you're forced off the crest
soldier of misfortune
hunting with bated breath

a vile smell, like tasting death
dead bodies, dying and wounded
litter the city streets
shattered glass, bits of clothing and human deceit
dying in terror
blood's cheap, it's everywhere
mandatory suicide, massacre on the front line i stab you right between the eyes
you awaken from the lies
i said it ever since the inception
where the masters of deception
i'm a godless heretic
not a god-fearing lunatic
that's why it's become my obsession
to treat god like an infection

my scars insane, my life profane
i deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!

like a storm that devastates
religious doubt i instigate
take a listen to my confession
there is no filter on my aggression
with a blister open wide
to keep the massacre alive
i got cold devastation
with my moral imperfection

my scars insane, my life profane
i deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!

religious death, i instigate
from what the bible demonstrates
does it document creation
of this hopeless infliction
of a godless heretic
not a god-fearing lunatic
that's why it's become my obsession
to treat god like an infection

my scars insane, my life profane
i deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!

open life scars, crushing open wounds
the walls of this scene will be crashing at you
you left senseless mentally unfit
never fucking heard from you again
never fucking heard from again [verse 1]
trapped in purgatory
a lifeless object, alive
awaiting reprisal
death will be their acquittance

raining blood
from a lacerated sky
bleeding its horror
creating my structure
now i shall reign in blood




[breakdown] gun down cold on a raw deal
home turf my battlefield
in no one's way caught in a crossfire
stray bullets can kill

[chorus]
expendable youths
fighting for possession
having control the principle obsession
rivalry and retribution
death the only solution

injured soul on the hard ground
head blown off face down
lying in a pool of blood
an accidental death homicide

[chorus]

struggling to survive
the drug induced warfare
to have control and principle obsession
expendable youth fighting for possession
violence is only a friend [intro]
aaah!!

[verse 1]
auschwitz, the meaning of pain
the way that i want you to die
slow death, immense decay
showers that cleanse you of your life
forced in like cattle
you run
stripped of
your life's worth
human mice, for the angel of death
four hundred thousand more to die

[chorus 1]
angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead

[verse 2]
sadistic, surgeon of demise
sadist of the noblest blood
destroying, without mercy
to benefit the aryan race
surgery, with no anesthesia
feel the knife pierce you intensely
inferior, no use to mankind
strapped down screaming out to die




[chorus 2]
angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead
infamous butcher
angel of death

[verse 3]
pumped with fluid, inside your brain
pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
burning flesh drips away
test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
frigid cold cracks your limbs
how long can you last
in this frozen water burial?
sewn together, joining heads
just a matter of time
'til you rip yourselves apart
millions laid out in their
crowded tombs
sickening ways to achieve
the holocaust

[verse 4]
seas of blood, bury life
smell your death as it burns
deep inside of you
abacinate, eyes that bleed
praying for the end of
your wide awake nightmare
wings of pain, reach out for you
his face of death staring down
your blood running cold
injecting cells, dying eyes
feeding on the screams of
the mutants he's creating
pathetic harmless victims
left to die
rancid angel of death
flying free

[spoken:]
lying, dying, screaming in pain
begging, pleading, bullets drop like rain
mines explode, pain sheers through your brain
radical amputation, this is insane




fly swatter stakes drive through your chest
spikes impale you as you're forced off the crest
soldier of misfortune
hunting with bated breath

a vile smell, like tasting death
dead bodies, dying and wounded
litter the city streets
shattered glass, bits of clothing and human deceit
dying in terror
blood's cheap, it's everywhere
mandatory suicide, massacre on the front line high velocity bullet at close range
can damage the mind
shattering the skull, shredding the brain
severing the spine
bury a round of lead in the chest
it's quite an impression
imagine the innards of your soul
the infliction

instinctive regression
with intent to kill
no regard of human life
or the blood spilled

riddled convulsions
confetti of flesh
scattered helplessly
losing your control of physical facilities
release the slide to cleanse inside
prepare to anoint
snap the tongue in the groove discharge
to make my hallowed point

instinctive regression
with intent to kill
no regard of human life
or the blood spilled




power of a gun
used with conviction
dispersed on excursions
randomly kills its victims
my sweet revenge
bitter in depression
the thrilling release
of a hatred deep persuasion

power of a gun
used with conviction
diffused compulsions
unending repercussions
violent emotion
screaming revulsion
spasmic convulsions
death an empty gun [intro]
an unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
unsuspecting victims no warnings no signs
judgment day the second coming arrives
before you see the light you must die

avidity and lust controlled by hate

show your flesh eaten away
beyond the gates i'll take you

afterlife confessions
tell me who you used to be
looking on in wonder
as i show you it was me

you know one spark is all it takes
hear the piercing cries of all
who found that hell awaits

you really have no choice
faded memories haunt you
listen closely to my voice
feed me all your hatred
empty all your thoughts to me
i can fill your emptiness
with immortality

welcome to my world
involve yourself within my dream
experience a life just like your mind thought not to be

join in my quest to leave life overturned
spanning the world wave of doom
spewing out death with the evil i've churned
awaken the dead from their tombs
love turns to lust, the sensations i've felt
exploring the pleasures of sin
making the best of the cards i've been dealt
adjusting the odds so i win

unleash all my burning wrath
potential killing machine
take down all who block my path
enjoying all that's obscene, born of fire

[instrumental break]

prince of all darkness initiation
ritually baptised in flames
next to the throne, my abomination
spread terror throughout my domain
master the art that controls the impure
inherit the infamous keys

a name i cannot deny
wielding fury that's second to none
far too vile to confine, born of fire

[instrumental break]

all things dead must rise again
when twilight's blanket falls
splattered red, you'll find my den
blood dripping from the walls

dreams born of desire
shaped, forged within the fire
twisted, warped, deranged i see
the world's corrupt insanity

[instrumental break]

dreams possess nightmarish figures
burning, can't escape the embers
lost are those who trust the liar
satan's son, i'm born of fire

harlots of hell spread your wings

feel the fire shoot through your body

satan's child now stalks the earth
born from my demon seed

[chorus]
hot wings of hell
burns in my wake
death is what you pray
behold captor of sin

infernal slaves of manipulation
captive of my vice

subversive action will not help
it will strengthen me
i see decline your every move
death your final plea

hot wings of hell
burns in my wake
death is what you pray

your skin turns to leather
i ignite your timid blood

mindless tyranny, forgotten victims
children slaughtered in vain
raping the maids, in which they serve
only the words of the lord

die by the sword
die by the sword

[verse 2]
satan watches all of us
smiles as some do his bidding
try to escape the grasp of my hand
and your life will no longer exist
hear our cry, save us from
the hell in which we live
we turn our heads toward the sky
and listen for the steel

[chorus]
die by the sword
die by the sword




[bridge]
watch as flowers decay
on the cryptic life that died
the wisdom of the wizards
is only a nurtured lie
black knights of hell's domain
walk upon the dead
satanas sits upon
the blood on which he feeds

[chorus]
die by the sword
die by the sword unknown are the caverns of the mind
new realms of affliction lurk inside
unbound massive mental energy
your last breaths taken from you easily

incoherence disrupts your rationale
involuntary your last confessional
no sense of being missing segments of time
inconsistency is feeding on your mind

[lead: hannemann]

mind control, pain unfolds
i own all your sensations
weakening, reasoning
mesmeric full demolition
hypnotized - victimized
behold the threshold to the web
screaming souls fear echoes
piercing boundaries of the dead

[lead: king]

penetration of the window to your soul
deterioration of the mind, no self control
temporarily comprehend no memories
hollow carcass of a man is all i leave




execution but a thought in the end
slowly erasing your life and what has been

(lead - hanneman) [instrumental intro]

funeral held for the depression of man
holds the key to his own death
entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
tighten the tourniquet around your neck
sifting away the debris of hated life
cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
seeking life beyond your perishment
repeating words echoing through your mind

chanting lines of blind witchery
to save yourself from extinction
wanting to die is your reason to live
new life born from the oppressed
taste your blood as it trickles through the air
another casualty beyond the shadows you fall
losing ground, the fate you feel draws near
fatality, reality, await the final call

[instrumental break]

my sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity
vessels in my brain carrying death until my birth
come and die with me forever, share insanity




do you wanna die?!

the waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies
turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind
non-rising body from the grave showing new reality
what i am, what i want, i’m only after death

[instrumental outro] [intro]
aaah!!

[verse 1]
auschwitz, the meaning of pain
the way that i want you to die
slow death, immense decay
showers that cleanse you of your life

human mice, for the angel of death
four hundred thousand more to die

[chorus 1]
angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead

inferior, no use to mankind
strapped down screaming out to die

[chorus 2]
angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead
infamous butcher
angel of death

pumped with fluid, inside your brain
pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes

frigid cold cracks your limbs
how long can you last

sewn together, joining heads
just a matter of time
'til you rip yourselves apart
millions laid out in their
crowded tombs
sickening ways to achieve
the holocaust

[verse 4]
seas of blood, bury life
smell your death as it burns
deep inside of you
abacinate, eyes that bleed

down in this hell

spells surround me day and night
stricken by the force of evil light
the force of evil light

cast under his spell
blinding my eyes
twisting my mind

fight to resist the evil inside
captive of a force of satan's might
a force of satan's might

laughing in sorrow
crying in lust

my strength slips fast, soon i must fall
victim of fortune, my sources grow small
life slips away as demons come forth
death takes my hand and captures my soul




[instrumental outro] this fucking country's lost it's grip
sub-conscious hold begins to slip
the scales of justice begin to tip

the legal system has no spine
it's corroding from inside
slap your hand and you'll do no time

reality on vacation
all across a blinded nation
mentally under sedation

anyone can be set free
on a technicality
explain the law again to me

here in 1994
things are different than before
violence is what we adore

invitation to the game
guns and blades and media fame
every day more of the same

murder, mayhem, anarchy
now are all done legally
mastermind your killing spree




unafraid of punishment
with a passive government
there's nothing for you to regret

nothing to regret

unimposing policy
no enforcing ministry
gaping with judicial flaws
watch a fading nation crawl

clashing with the public's frame
i'm the one that's place in fame
legislature sets the stage
social slaves caught in my rage
administrative anarchy there's nothing
you can do to me
the world around you is drifting to a
continental tomb you see
violence is my passion
i will never be contained
living with aggression and it's
everlasting reign
