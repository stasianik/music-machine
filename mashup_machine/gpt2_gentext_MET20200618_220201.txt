and i was in any way
as good as this, okay?

and i know you feel that way too.

i'm not saying that this is the way

on the move, on my side
when the time is right'.

i'll be back
i'll be here
i'll be here
i'll be here
i'm okay.

you're almost there.

- are you sure it's okay?
- i mean, i'm almost there.

i'm almost there.

- you don't seem to be having any problems.
- i've had a little trouble trusting what i've seen.

- you're not having any problems with bathing
- they're pretty common
in villa life.

well, i'm almost there.

have a look at those eyes
they give me nightmares,

they tell me to shut my mouth
and to come to your house

but i can't, you can't, run
this thing through me.

so i've had to fucking fake it
almost entirely

and i can't even speak to pop
when i want to
because i'm just so used to it.

you know
====================
is that you want old, black, and white?
and was that a choice?
and can you imagine?
cutting a deal
you cut the throat of the enemy
and now i wait my whole lifetime for you
to stab you in the back the moment i see you smile
oh, please god, change
make me go
back to the fucking place
where the hero died
where the pain never ends
yeah, please, god, change
my friend the one you lost
who used to be here
i'm only human, but i know what's coming
when there's no one to help me
i'll just go away now
my friend the one you lost
used to be here
i'm only human, but i know what's coming
when there's no one to help me
i'll just go away now
ooh, please, god, change
my friend the one you lost
how much longer?

there's a fog of war going on in the east
that keeps me focused though i've gone astray
a western front i must face
now the Ottomans are BRUTALLY dead
now the Russians are GREY
yes, we do exist
but a nuclear Iran would solve all our intractable foreign
and biggest fear
is becoming a pro-rata cunt
people living off the profits from my drift
i shall return to
my Weston home
where i once lived
where i raised my six children

but now it's time to jump ship
and i must find my feet

so build a wall, put your foot down
and be strong buddy
there's lots of people there who are
not as strong or my age
and they're not nice
and i cannot bear to see
it's coming to this
now the Russians are
BRUCE!

now the Ottomans are
GREY!


====================
and i think it's dope
because you guys don't wanna hear it.

i'm just trying to do something
different.

i mean, i didn't--
i guess i didn't wanna hear it.

- right.
- but, fuck, we don't have
the luxury of dreams.

we don't have the luxury of dreams.

we don't even--
we can get there.

- "we don't have the luxury of dreams."
- okay.

millions of people
are gonna pick up
the phone and say,
"hey, james,"

and we're gonna play
their shit off,"

we got the goods.

some ears, some eyes
and a heart
to the struggling man.

now we gotta find a way
to live a happy,

true, long, healthy, happy life.

it's a long, long, long, long,
iT space.

see, there's a very particular kind
of people who like to
dance and sing.

they're very, very talented.

they're very, very good at it.

they're digging it.

they're digging it.

anyway, here's the deal.

we're not gonna give in to their will

and we're not gonna let them get away
with it.

you know what i mean?

or the three of you.

- it's not about when you
want it.
- it's never, never, never,

very many years.

this is about how much
you suck.

- that's a lot of careless,
you know, saying.

- that's exactly what i'm saying.

- it's also:
- and i'm--
====================
queue is deceiving
it's deceiving
it's deceiving
it's deceiving
and if you think it's good, but not enough to get more, well, well, anywhere near this, you're just right
are you satisfied?
being satisfied
is your awareness higher than life?
beyond the black
or the light that is like a torch of incandescent light
you rise and you look down the barrel of a .50
better still, you walk into a dark room
and you're led into a room filled with make up dolls
and various cretins
each with their doll's soul
each with their part
they all hit the jackpot
and you need a doll's soul

whether it's the band, whether it's my new best friend, you know.

all of that stuff.

i don't know.

i'm just-- i don't--

i get the feeling there's--

that into this record,

some control issues.

maybe you're right
that these are--

maybe you're not.

but i'm getting kind of
convinced that
some kind of monster--

that this record is out of the future
or something.

i was just-- in some ways, i was
convinced that this record was kind of off track.

and if you were kind of, like,
some kind of a star, like, who we are,

then this would be out of the future...

- all right.
- are we, like,
gonna sit here and listen to something
that's, like,      albums
or something?

well, the way i feel about it,

is that this is the last time
you're gonna see us live.

we're gonna do some
themes and stories and all that stuff.

and after    years,

it's hard to describe.
just go away
and you're better off
with us.

you know, than without us.

you know,

themes and themes

and, you know, this is a really serious matter.

and these are serious matters,
and it needs to be addressed.

so i feel very strongly
that this is a real estate company

and we have to make sure
that the money’s right.

i’m not happy with that whole dispute
with you.

i’ve been working on this together for

with his careless dreaming?
been afraid, always afraid
of the things he's feeling
he could just be gone
he would just sail on

if i've got nowhere to go?
searched for seas of gold
how come it's got so cold?
how can i be lost?
in remembrance i relive
how can i blame you
when it's me i can't forgive?

is the individual.

i'm in a shit mood. pretty much.

look, there's a guy
in a really good mood on the tape.

but there's also definitely
a lack of interest in the band.

why is that?
because the band doesn't have
any direction.

you know, song titles,
seasons' worth of songs.

the band is in a shit mood,
you know?
still, i stand there
looking pretty much straight ahead

and hope something bad's to come
in the near future.

i'm in a shit mood
look, i ain't doing nothing.

i guess i'm strapped

deep down, deep down, yeah
oh please god

there's a job to be done and you can't do it alone
throwing a rock at the top of your lungs
just what is this? you say?
exploding at the end of the rope
what is this? you say?
exploding at the end of the rope
headlights flashing before his eyes
i've hitched a ride
to safety ahead
with a snap of a finger
a rock takes your life
taste me, you'll taste me
when the world falls to its knees
oh please god
exploding at the end of the rope
what is this? you say?
exploding at the end of the rope

taking off, speeding through blackened air.
he comes crawling, but he's too late."
fear in your eyes, friend," you must return."
lonely man," here i come," says the voice inside.
running as fast as it can, but damn it, it ain't right."
dying it all, terrorizing
====================
aeon!
you've come this far
bleed town, people eating dead leaves
disposable heroes, survive the apocalypse
all hell's breaking loose, can't you tell?
is there much that needs doing here?
with a svelte face and a grave full of lies
it's a survival game, you play it.
you play it.

one of the things that i love the best is
playing in the stands.

and i'm very interested to hear what you think.

first is your right,
second is your wrong,
third is any of that,

fourth is luck or the element
that determines our life course.

you know, that's the easy part about being
a real person.

then, lastly, is something
that you've said to me,

"i'd like to hear what you think,"

and that's what i heard
from your stand.

- oh, yeah.
- yeah, his or her voice
or what voice you think the bass player
deserves

should be able to provide the one
that best suits your personal
needs and mine."

you know, that's what i wanted--

to say what--
what's really important to me

is what the band
is playing.

and you told me what to play,

and what isn't to say.

in the spirit of equal opportunity
and the things that i believe in,

the choice you make

whether it's when you're at home
or in the band.

you can drop out
if you want.

but you still have the right
to say what you want to say

if it's needed to get through
or if it's good to say.

you can't drop out
if you want.

good morning, hey there. hello, hello there.
what now?, is there any of that that we should do
to celebrate?
well, ah ha ha you know, it's just--

- it's just part of the job.

oh, and, of course, you can always revert
to your old habits

but all the same, um, good.
