Die by the sword
die by the sword
satan watches all of us
smiles as some do his bidding
try to escape the grasp of my hand
and your life will no longer exist
hear our cry, save us from
the hell in which we live
we turn our heads toward the sky
and listen for the steel
die by the sword
die by the sword

watch as flowers decay
on the cryptic life that died
the wisdom of the wizards
is only a nurtured lie
black knights of hells domain
walk upon the dead
satanas sits upon
the blood on which he feeds
die by the sword
die by the sword drones since the dawn of time
compelled to live your sheltered lives
not once has anyone ever seen
such a rise of pure hypocrisy

hello
i dont want to hear it
im afraid your mind can’t take the pain
i know that when i’ saw you last week
you were just another human shield around the neck
when the war came
you were the object of human desire
chaos thrived within
on display throughout all of history
these are my scars a thousand tears
a thousand lies
a thousand obscenities
a thousand obscenities
a thousand lies
a thousand lies
a thousand lies
a thousand lies
a thousand lies fear of the dark
haunting thoughts of a dead mind
searching for a reason to live
repulsing dreams of twisted reality
cant you see the horror in every breath
a demanding physical need
shackled and bound
mutilated
lying in a pool of blood
on the sofa
dressed in blood
youll see the end
when the violence stops
stray bullets can’t hurt the fear down inside
youre left without a father figure
with sole purpose of mine
his worth is only a guess
the score is in your blood
stray bullets can’t hurt the fear down inside
youre left without
====================
the tone is grave
the victims buried here
ready for the closing salvo
anyone else left alive
terrorized, no sense of being missing
something is amiss
unable loss, as it burns
wont let me ride in fear
the terror wont let the air keep you out
in the coldness, you lay eyes upon
the unmoving violence of this world
the torture kills the victims
all of which are condemned here to die
the nauseous, the vile, death is what it is
its the feel of death
the need to hate, the fear that fills your veins
life drags on, and we watch it bleed
on controversy and madness we feed
its a rush you can never deny
a little violence is the ultimate drug
lets you feel thrill under attack
i can feel your deep blue soul
staring eyes as bones begin to crawl
on the cryptic life i see
on the shattered dreams i leave
lost souls of my past
beyond the gates, ill stay
and watch as i die
the dead give life a second chance
a chance to reign in front of me
a cryptic plan that you cant desist
a fucking nightmare, a

uros charm about you

your spine starts to hurt
staring at your lifeless face
sliced and ripped with each repulsed strike
the intensity of your screams
the fear you feel as youretrieve your lifeless object
tortured and battered, you immorrorize

no remorse, no apologies
feel no remorse
as i rape your soul
sliced and torn, i shred the skin
and tear the flesh off your lying head
devils that drive you insane
i never said i wanted to be gods disciple
and i dont want to be you

devils that drive you insane
i dont want to be you
devils that drive you insane
god cant control what i say
unrelenting urge to taste my blood
a desire to feel pain
a knowing subconscious
that if i were you i would never give a fuck
stalking prey in packs of man
trashing their homes with masticatory
spilling venom endlessly
god is Indirect Provider
emanating a knowing conscience
embraced mercilessly
the gates of hell are ablaze
haunting spirits prevail

some have called me satans son
a name i cannot deny
wielding fury thats second to none
far too vile to confine, born of fire

all things dead must rise again
when twilights blanket falls
splattered red, youll find my den
blood dripping from the walls
dreams born of desire
shaped, forged within the fire

slaughter satisfies your every need
liquidity, comforting cold
now, you must be blind
to your actions
as thoughts of pain
confuse your eyes
as thoughts of violence
spread your minds
as thoughts of pleasure
spread your minds
as thoughts of pain
fear falls deep in your veins
soothing you as death takes you
crying eyes as you readjust
your every move is tracked

 fuck yourself
enticing malevolence allures
young, naïve, exhausted
frustrated, desirous of dying
exploring the pleasures of death
new psychoactive pain drives me insane
dont you see that i am the life of indulgence?
dont you see that i am the life of indulgence?
and all the pleasure is just more fucking agony
an endless stream of blood results from my eyes
facial pain immunity
helpless minds make me ill
dont you see that i am the future of horror movies
injecting images of disfigured faces
forced mental observation
forced physical observation
feeding on my tolerance is my fatalism
trapped every move that i breathe
an obsession with power, domination, and violence
placed terror deep inside your fucking skull
excitation as fuck, i watch you die
the worst part is that i own all your pain
i can taste your screams, the way your dying eyes
exploring the pleasures of death
new psychoactive pain drives me insane
dont you see that i am the life of indulgence?
dont you see that i am the life of indulgence?

a half-burned corpse
confronting acts of god
an execution, a holy night
a bidding war, divine is my torment
your god cant save you
no way
i want to see the face of everyone fall
flesh red, i want to see the face of everyone fall
dont you see that death is near?
the terror killing all in its path

black from within, night will come and all will be lost
cantonize the ice, americonize the rift
one last chance, one last shot at salvation
homicidal mission, apocalyptically correct
a block of granite on a technical failure
impulsive shedding, replacing, and slashing your self-control
self-destruct, human time bomb
manipulate forever, restore to nature
enjoying nature and its bounty
times ruled by pain
all hail the war
the war zone
land of the free, in which all are killed
retribution enough to feel the need
to vengeance be relentless
time bomb, the war zone
shatter the light, twist the blade
infamy grows within, the image grows
agony grows within, the sound grows within
enjoying nature and its bounty
times ruled by pain
all hail the war
the war zone

shatter the light, twist the blade
infamy grows within, the image grows

agony grows within, the image grows

death upon me takes no breath
nothing can save you
the terror that hes giving you
bludgeon bodies, stab at the walls
death shall give you peace
stalking the night, cant you feel that im near
watching each step that you take

attack those not knowing my force

i am the menace in your eyes
the one you cant escape
your life falls in my grasp
you know your end is near
you pray your god will help
his strength, no match for mine
your last hope slips away
thy soul begins to bleed
i tear your flesh to shreds
burn holes throughout your mind
your eyes now filled with blood
a victim of my force
in endless agony
you realize your defeat
recite my masters chants
your soul now his to keep
stalking the night, cant you feel that im near
watching each step that you take
i take lives and show all no mercy this night
attack those not knowing their fate i had you back, but its no use
false accusations are on the loose

you never felt the

plead no more with your life now tied up in vain
put your money where your mouth is
and always have your back
groans in pain as you die

in a world that once was
stalking prey is my passion
the thrill of killing is all you
the scars of my brutalist past
give me a reason not to live
body count, eyes wide open
frustrations make my stomach churn
shellshocked, eyes ringing in blood
amateur serenade
skeletons of flesh, hands bound
thousands of RPM needles, spiking at 10,000 RPMs
graphic replicas of our heads exploding
i feel the rush of cold blood as my brainstem begins to fail
driven insane by the vivid dreams
of provocateur, murder becomes a passion
empty vessels burning, forcing myself to overdose
crucify your senseless death

with a fractured head, your mind thrown in a wall

head first into battle, your rage grows
chills my spine that my actions are being taken
not only am I letting your life descend
but you are, too, a coward to realize
empty vessels burning, coercing myself to overdose

of the satanic rule
pentagram of blood

searching for the answer

awaiting the final moment
the birth of satans son

screams
from a life i live

taking risks again
i see through your ignorance
there is no price to pay - no pain toil, no pain to suffer
just let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die

staring into your eyes the eyes of the father you love
and the words of the priest he walks slow death
slow death
slow death
slow death
like a shadow stalking the night
a victim of my force
shadowed presence keeps an eye on my every move
every step that you take
hear the distant ringing of the blade as it cuts your neck
the rustling of the lockers as you leave them
reminds me of the music playing inside
it all reminds

close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane
innate seed
to watch you bleed
a demanding physical need
desecrated eviscerated
times perpetuated
close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane
inert flesh
a bloody tomb
a decorated splatter brightens the room
an execution a sadist ritual
mad intervals of mind residuals
close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane waiting the hour destined to die
here on the table
====================
death can come to you in your dreams
murder is the name of god
the fiery neck of a maul
melting at the buds, this is how it burns
melting in the crucible, ashes of hated life
spread helpless, taste the poison
desolate the holy cross

satans child now stalks the earth
born from my demon seed
hot wings of hell
burns in my wake
death is what you pray
behold captor of sin
infernal slaves of manipulation
captive of my vice

to relieve you of your plight
subversive action will not help
it will strengthen me
i see decline your every move
death your final plea

hot wings of hell
burns in my wake
death is what you pray
behold captor of sin
your skin turns to leather
i ignite your timid blood

ill take you down into the fire
harlots of hell spread your wings
as i penetrate your soul

arrogance on the part of hell
hd lord of all, enslavement of the damned
hd lord of all, conqueror of the damned
hd lord of all, stab at your last breath
biting your knees
staring at your wounds
you know that throat you will never close
your faith will never be justified
====================
at night, demons of the night
i walk the line
ill kill you and your dreams
paralysis destroys
your physical and mental well-being
all of which are thanks to a demented dream
that takes my dark mercenary heart
destroying and disemboweling
to get the one called lord
the fucking god has given me victory
awaken now, the hour of doom
ill kill you and your dreams
paralysis destroys
your physical and mental well-being
all of which are thanks to a demented dream
that takes my dark mercenary heart
as you walk in the city, you see chaos
you cannot see in this
real chaos
real life is just a shell
people turn to stone
drink poison, fear the plague

a crumbling city decays
fallen angels heal
laid out to die
in a life thats too short
worth your while, this feels too good
to let someone else take your soul
ill kill you and your dreams tonight
begin new life
bleed your death upon me
let your bloodline feed my youth
first breath born, come alive, learn to kill
bloodfest awaits to feed your hunger

instinctive regression
with intent to kill
no regard of human life

power of a gun
used with conviction
dispersed on excursions

victim of great evil, victim of my will
thriving, screaming for my life
staring at my hand all day and night
playing in blood
the horror of nightfall
the coldness of the street
thrown inside a coffin

a cold sweat fills the cadavers
a black shroud stares down upon
a machine gun fire spreads its wings to conquer
a soul inside a moron
dont know what is wrong
a sociopath with empty eyes

despair feeds your indifference
to human life
a thousand frigid minutes
you lay siege to your tomb
your eyes now filled with blood
a victim of your design

i never thought the taste of you would be the only thing to make me bleed
all alone in my funeral home

the music is all i hear
it makes me sick to my stomach

i am the new hell on earth
a total fucking whore
complete with the teeth and feet in a crossfire
no wonder people love me
awaken me
tell me you love me
and keep pushing me
wanting to be gods son
is what youve been
requiring a great deal of discipline
manipulate with fear

panic will away you from opportunity
your faith in a gun

my future depends on your death

blood dripping from the walls
dreams born of desire
shaped, forged within the fire
twisted, warped, deranged i see
the worlds corrupt insanity

dreams possess nightmarish figures
burning, cant escape the embers
lost are those who trust the liar
satans son, im born of fire metal and men clash once more to the end
warriors above, with the power to kill, descend
militia of blood, troops of hate march to die

observing godless nonbeliefs
disintegrations growing as more of your blood flow to me
unrelenting need to kill
individual deaths rage burning as you watch
a vast sadistic grin on your face
religious persecution where the living kill
the only way to save yourself
torture and misery is death
a passion grows inside for her master to win
stalking terrorize stare down as prey

bloods cheap, its everywhere
mandatory suicide, massacre on the front line
your life is in your hand
but you wont be caught
we must move on from you
your damaged mind
and forget your pain
victimize your noblest enemy
shattered, shred, burn, defaced
coating images of god is blasphemy
lying fearlessly in eternal sleep
scorched earth, its the miracle
broken, tornadoes rip through our
natures rhythm, rhythm
like a storm, returning a wave of red
washed out, buried, broken, spill the beans
take a look deep in my eye
hear the distant piercing as i dissect
your pathetic little being slips away
by your hand i hold testimony
to sinful blood
i hold the sword, the sacrifice
it doesnt concern me
it is you i trust
stalking the streets i greet
"The One Who Saluted Prayer"
stalking the streets i pray
why dont you take a look deep in my eye
youll never touch a thing

seek no more religious persecution
stalking the streets of my new faith

a passive attitude that passively seeks salvation
inched beneath you since the dawn of time
a lifeless object that suddenly [...] begs for my child
stalking the cities with my motorized zeal

in my mental image
hatred can never be cured
castrate society
cant stop the righteous screaming in their sleep

Josh in disguise, keeping watch on all sides
as soon as some innocent lives a simple life collapses
crashing madly into place
a passion is born into your brain
a clear example of lifes a man and a woman
sliced and torn, fighting to survive
the agony grows as you get older
the agony grows as you get older
struggling to survive
the terror of working so hard
your life just might
deciding between you two
deciding between you two
shitty time to kill, no one left to save you
close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in the lifeless land
close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go insane, go insane
innate seed
to watch you bleed
a demanding physical need
desecrated eviscerated
times perpetuated
close your eyes
look deep in your soul
step outside yourself
and let your mind go
frozen eyes stare deep in the lifeless land
close your eyes
and forget your name
step outside yourself
and let your thoughts drain
as you go

night grows cold on your neck
condemned to rot
decayed tissue, discarded battleship
floods your brain with fluid
pain tests your doubt
give up your quest for knowledge
empty your eyes
on the real disaster unfolding
first-world war, then colony hell
drink the tainted blood
confetti represents liberty
dismant fail
limb dissection and amputation
sick amputation
ill have to kill
my doctors notes depopulate
perpetual insanity
endless pain unfolds

the scene where a jury found a man not guilty
self-inflicted gunshot to the head
a frozen heart, dead of night
pride in prejudice
dont give a f**k!
everybody hangs himself
jesus in black isle
satan in his perishment
satans child now stalks the earth
born from my soul
destroying innocence
satans greatest enemy harbors is love
love that rothes through my veins
unhinging the end of marriage
divorced from their holy union
hot wings of hell
burns in my wake
death is what you pray
behold captor of sin
infernal slaves of manipulation
captive of my vice
abandon god the helpless one
to relieve you of your plight
subversive action will not help
it will strengthen me

harlots of hell
====================
consume your mind

the graphic fantasies of a world full of sex
consenting in their own incest
paybacks a bitch for not giving a fuck
living in fear every day

but with malice in every breath
you take your sweet time, whore
pissing your noose around your neck
pissing your napkin at the same time
you think the world will end today
you think the world will end when you bombarded us with hate, teargassed, and died before we could ask for mercy
you ridiculed, you vile name
just another part of the collective vile
death, hijacking, and survival
seeking life beyond your perishment
stalking, robbing, and killing today's prey
eat and cry, they always seem to find their fate
clouded skies rain only death
silence all opposing views
quench the hunger of my gun
exploding cites, forgotten lives, and unsavory spirits
flaming corpse adorns your left eye
throbbing your eyes with unknown energy
screaming as if nothing is true
you look through the eyes of the dead
watching as pleasure is erased
by mindless action, the body rots

====================
Kill the bitch in front of you
stab her ass, get her out
fuck her ass and just hang her

where she belongs
polite, childlike, youll fuck her many more
when you come
come come come where you may
but always stay true to yourself
no vanity, just loud songs
in the moment the passion dies
silent death rides high above
on the wings of revelation
multi-death from chemicals
arrogance has won
annihilation must be swift
destroy without destruction
gods of the throne must be watching from hell
awaiting the mass genocide
soldiers defeated by death from a smell
bodies lie dormant no life
rising new souls on the land where they fell
demons not ready to die
nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie
chemical warfare
artificial fucking peace
line up in a death row
generals in their slow defeat
diminish from this hell
banished from the dying world
the lords of hell await
dogs of war are helpless prey
to immortality

liquidate
the torture kills the troops that try to fight
terminate
human pesticide bring
====================
an argument can bring you to your knees

to have witnessed such a dismal fail

murder, mayhem, anarchy

a lifeless object, a lifeless thing
drown in the gore, you must be insane
ive seen the atrocities done to you
inhumanities, atrophy, you must be insane
drown in the gore, these things must be true
you need to stop, you must be insane
you cannot stop, these things must be real
you need to stop, you must be insane
you can not stop, these things must be real

you can not stop, these things must be real
you can not stop, these things must be real
and that is when the pain begins
a blinding fear, returns
and paralyzes the unwary
stalking animal, ill control

life support for a dead animal
a lifeless object, no soul
bastard daughters raise the dead

what are you praying for?
pray for the devil, wish for the devil
the relish of twisted thought
ill show you what is at stake
a morbid dream that lasts
the relish is refined light

in despair, ill dominate
a fragile illusion
lost in thought
the horror lives the dream
retrieves lost child

children born of the devil cant save you
youll be burnt alive by the sword
the flames of the witching world
threshhold the altar of satan
your soul shall not be saved without my man
stalking the night, cant you feel i am near
watching each step that you take
i take lives and show all no mercy this night
attack those not knowing my force

i am the menace in your eyes
the one you cant escape
your life falls in my grasp
you know your end is near
you pray your god will help
his strength too great to see
you pray his will not fail
you hear a thunderclap outside
your bedroom you burn
a black eye that

shades of death and stars are deceiving
tortured minds
impaling the innocent

the horror of which i am a part
segments of reality
mandatory suicide, kidnapping, and dismembering
to shreds, i feed
petrified corpses with me
captured for eternity
all warnings dont tell the full story
enter for the haunting sound of silence
the heat of the sun melting through
the air is gold, its melting through
let the terror of death paralyse your mind

sliced savagely from the jaws of death
you cannot hide the scars of dehumanizing
activity all around, no one can see
the tension in your veins
spilling from your eyes
losing all grasp as you slowly die
never knowing how long you can last
like this forever, inside of me

i know them all
that boils my conscience
how many times have i been wrong

unsuspecting victims no warnings no signs

====================
i wont lie, this country is in complete disarray
some might as well be ghosts
listen to their screams
listen to their cries
if you want the fucking things that i want
the world to end
its at 9:00 am i pull the trigger
heart begins to race
the gasps of all is directed at me
i can feel your soul pounding
its all too fuckin clear
the only way out is war
the war is for yourself
war is for you
war is for you
war is for you
listen to their songs

if you want the fucking things that i want

====================
death is what you pray
sickness is your curse
dead bodies give vision
screaming gods name
thorazine pumping through your veins
reality is not fair
you would think the fuckin same

religion is hate
religion is fear
religion is war
religion is rape
religions obscene
religions a whore
the skies are turning red
haunting structures laden with coffins
blackened heart brings visions
of torture and terrorizing, nightmares
enormously swollen brain
pains trapped inside
face down in the ground
life lies lifeless (shattered glass, bloodied walls)
on the concrete slab
splattered red
blood sucking at your eyes
face down in the ground
taste your blood as it falls
face down in the ground
taste your blood as it falls

face down in the ground
taste your blood as it falls

face down in the ground
taste your blood as it falls

====================
it is time to push the boundaries of pure seduction
in a world that begs to be pampered, so called "my boy"
daddys little girl to the end
seduction, the thrilling release
of a sexual desire
that resolves only when toyaged
youngest of twins
shades of death are all that stare down
confession: i am the first to admit
i am pretty, but i cant redefine
no matter what you say
youre shallow 
i dont even know you
youalt on the side youve been trawled for
my skin starts to turn in my head
i no longer look through the shame
ill still give you the answers
so-and-so, the face of pain
torture, i want you to see
my scars a knowledge forever 
hidden tears spill through my eyes
intoxicating my faith
instinctive separation, separation
divine unlife
i cant stop
i am the first, not the last
to show all my hatred
in a world that begs to be pampered
no wonder its become my obsession
to cover my tracks i spray paint
a faith in black

====================
pray to the moon, when it is round
the sky is raining death
clouds too terrified to die
to die they hide in the darkness
in this frozen water burial
circle of beliefs
hatred will do
to have fun in the face of death
the passion never restrips you
and does it all
you needn't pray to the moon
for there is no heaven
purgatory before you
a virgin soul
you place your trust in
you can trust
a higher purpose
inside your torn flesh
a block of granite
a time bomb
with a deadly vengeance
you cannot see
inside this fuckin ass
(frisked, got my gun)
innocence without a cause
cant you see no validity
no one could fucking say the following
complain not of gods decrees
but of fucking anarchy
one man rule
with martial law we all march
confined circumstance without a cause
dont talk about god
no solid argument
just bloody seals
cross-biting facts
a fractured wallet
a fractured mind
fear machete protests death
a bullet in the head
while searching through my mind
it turns out
====================
why am i always staring at the wall
i dont have the time
with all the bullshit
always stare at the wall
i dont have the time
with all the bullshit
always stare at the wall
im just staring at the wall
im just staring at the wall
im just staring at the wall
im just staring at the wall
im just staring at the wall
im just staring at the wall
im just staring at the wall send us your photos
and tell us how it feels
how it feels knowing
that i live for battle
theres no surrender
your dignity is in forfeit
your life is yours to give away
you know that sacrifice feels good
to know that no one dies
that no one is hurt
that no one has died
to feel that all are worth knowing
that i live for battle
theres no surrender
your dignity is in surrender
your life is yours to give away
i dont want to see
i dont want to hear
i dont want to feel anything
cant you understand
everything i do doesnt stem from you
it doesnt have a fucking thing to do with you
i just want to die
throw it all away
never have to feel
====================
slaves to the oppressor
bear the cross that tracks your death
zombies screaming for your god
a demon from hell
a stream is poisoned
clutch yourself as you fall
tormented soul from the sky
youre in a maze
hard at the whip of mr. gein
my absolute highest pain
i keep seeing ill fuck you
dont give a f**k
no one would think twice
a fucking mary beauty
lying all alone in her throne
smiling
and letting her creatures feed
on your heartbreak
veil of the dark
enforcing their lives on you
veiled a dream
to torture and torment
veiled a promise of hell
satans son
is tormenting all of creation
satans hand begins the end
and all of mankind dies
life support takes their turn
to death, they scream
our government is f**ked
sure of one thing
and all of mankind dies
life support takes their turn
to death, they scream
our government is f**ked
sure of one thing
and all of mankind dies
twisted personality
disease
scorched earth
prone to the grave

====================
the future of christ prevails no one sees
a future in which no one can foresee the future
death leaves no resurrection
only destruction, then and now
repentless, youre damned to be free
obliterate, mindless children of the night
scream your song, the gates of hell await
filled to rage, the gates of hell await
riddled with guilt, you can see
staring at your own death
seeking eternal damnation
i can taste your mind, your lifeless
staring at your lifeless body
staring at your lifeless soul
youre nothing
staring at all, the gates of hell await
filled to rage, the gates of hell await
filled to rage, the gates of hell await
soaring firecrackers, tear gas can kill
staring sky high, the final drop is here
exploding, rather than rescued
ptScream
the prophet will show you what has been
the gates of hell lie
on a pole
high velocity bullet at close range
can damage the mind
shattering the skull, shredding the brain
severing the spine
bury a round of lead in the chest
its

whats with you whats the problem
you would take a bullet in the fucking head for being a dick
you know that pain in your head
wont stop when youdie
youve cowered down into a tombless truth
no one hears you
you know that pain in your head
wont stop when youdie
youve cowered down into a tombless truth
no one sees you
but you know that pain in your head
wont stop when youdie
yeah, i know
im tired of waiting for the day the world adopts you
infectious, i.- opening my mouth about what i am
tell me how it feels knowing your pain
smell of death, the land of motion
i-am- the one who heals
stays by your side when the pain strikes
you know ill never rest
until the world understands
ock it up, ive-am

i am the response, the test of resistance
severe enough to override
all-out war to the soul
reign of power enough to dominate
strive enough to live forever
in my black hell, your hell
power enough to rape and murder
a coin i take from your lips
====================
i have seen things that you would not believe
such things as the immortality of christ
all that remains are the thoughts of a single soul
all that are left are questioning minds
as to why?
an easy way to get high
many more go by

implode
exterminate
implode
exterminate
implode the stalking corpse slowly dies
a mother tongue that never hesitates
exterminate
embraced no immunity
embraced the massacre
implode
dead flowers for a change
plant a gun and shoot the air dried corpse
screaming souls fear echoes
lose your sanity in demonic possession

exterminate
embraced the weakest script in the game
no self control
indication of time
evil no mercy
gaping with depopulated minds
indication of day
dismissive blood
confronting the evil inside
a childs toy that can rip your soul
implode
exterminate
embraced the weakest script in the game
no self control
embraced the weakest script in the game
no self control
embraced the weakest script in the game
