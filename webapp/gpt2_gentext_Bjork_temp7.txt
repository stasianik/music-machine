one breath away from mother oceania
your nimble feet make prints in my sands
you have done good for yourselves
since you left my wet embrace
and crawled ashore
every boy is a snake, is a lily
every pearl is a lynx, is a girl
sweet like harmony made into flesh
you dance by my side
children sublime
you show me continents
i see islands
you count the centuries
i blink my eyes
hawks and sparrows race in my waters
stingrays are floating
across the sky
little ones, my sons and my daughters
your sweat is salty
i am why, i am why
i am why
your sweat is salty
i am why, i am why
i am why, i am why

all alone
there's no-one here
and people everywhere
crying 'cause i need you
crying i can feel you
crying 'cause i need you
crying 'cause i care
it's a hot day and i'm dressed lightly
i move carefully through the crowd
here everyone is so vulnerable
and i'm as well
there's no-one here
and people everywhere
crying 'cause i need you
crying i can feel you
crying 'cause i need you
crying 'cause i care
only if a ship would sail in

come on, girl
let's sneak out of this party
it's getting boring
there's more to life than this
it's still early morning
we could go down to the harbor
and jump between the boats
and see the sun come up
you know that there's more to life than this?
you know that there's more to life?
you know that there's more to life than this?
you know that there's more to life?
you know that there's more to life than this?

====================
i have wanted to do this for years
now, almost every day, i swallow huge pieces of cake
still craving a light snack that doesn't burst into pieces
sometimes i even dream up new mysteries
new mysteries i don't know how to answer
explain to my wife of 13 years
why can't i go back to the past?
why is it that i'm lured here by dream?
how come out of all the rooms in the house
that have a mirror?
where all the lights are in the house
and the servants in the house
it is in the past
and the past is getting in the way
it is in the way
it is in the way
i want to go back to the past, the past is getting in the way
it is in the way
it is in the way
it's in the past, it's in the way
it's in the way
it's in the way
it's in the way

no one is a lover alone

when i was little, my mother's house in the south-west of England
fell to the ground and burst into flame
when i was nine years old, my father's farm in the far south-west of the country
fell to the ground and burst into flame
when i was just nine years old, my mother's house in the far south-west of the country
fell to the ground and burst into flame
when i was just nine years old, my father's house in the far south-west of the country

when i was just nine years old, my father's house in the far south of the country
fell to the ground and burst into flame
when i was just nine years old, my mother's house in the far south of the world

our mother was a musical
her musicale was the world
air was precious
and her home made
rose-shouldered her charioteer

all bosoms were closed
and i was surrounded
my mother was a noble girl
lying naked on her bed
crystalline
eternal
i have shielded my tears
since childhood
i have been given to protect
my tears are the strongest signals
i've been placed before the world
so you can understand
your mother was a musical
her musical was the world
earth was precious
and her home made
rose-shouldered her charioteer

all bosoms were closed
and i was separated
you were not allowed
i was separated
from what i could do
what i had done was not allowed
i was separated
from what i should do
what i was doing was not allowed
i was separated
from what i should do
what i was doing was not allowed
i was separated
from what i should do
what i was doing was not allowed
i was separated

restlessness is the most beautiful instinct
relentless, wide awake
when i wake up
the first time
i feel you clambering up to me
cliffhanger like suspension
i'm holding my breath
in wonder - what is it?
what is it?
what is it that i can do?
i've never been before
the human eye sees
the divine
and follows a path
that takes us everywhere
i'm no different
from any other
and doesn't scatter
like the bugs do
i'm a breeze to breeze
i'm a breeze to breeze
handling' is the most important
thought
and the least talked about
and the least understood
i'm the man
i'm the man
i'm the man
how can you dismiss me?
how can you dismiss me?
i'm the one that's missing
darling this morning
darling this morning
darling this morning
i'm so sorry
i'm so sorry
i'm so sorry
i'm so sorry
i'm so sorry
i'm so sorry
i'm so sorry

knowing i adore you

bird, bird
hearer, listener
there's more to life than this
you know that i adore you?
you know that i love you?
you know that i love you?
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm
jump off
your building's on fire
and i'll catch you
i'll catch you
destroy all that is keeping you down
and then i'll nurse you
i'll nurse you
you know that i love you?
you know that i love you?
you know that i love you?
you know that i love you?
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm

get over the sorrow, girl
the world is always going to be made of this
you can trust in it
unless you breathe in
bravely
i adore how you simply surrender to high
and your lungs, they're mourning
t-b style
all the stillborn love that could've happened
all the moments you should have embraced
all the moments you should have not locked up
understand so clearly:
to shut yourself up
would be the hugest crime of them all
hugest crime of them all
you're just crying after all
to not want them humans around
anymore
get over that sorrow, girl
get over it

got down on her knees
the beast is back!
on four legs
set her clock to the moon
raises her spine
vertebrae by vertebrae

looking
i have been filled with steam for months, for years
same old cloud, claustrophobic me
let it burst like old train sounds
make them leave me nature
vertebrae by vertebrae
by vertebrae

my arms ooze out of my shoulders!
and the arms ooze out of my shoulders
i curl my tail inwards, inwards
i set my clock on the moon

once you fell out of love
our love couldn't carry you
and i didn't even notice
for our love kept me safe from death
you doubted the light
and the shelter it can give
for in love we are immortal
eternal and safe from death
if i regret us
i'm denying my soul to grow
don't remove my pain
it is my chance to heal
we carry the same wound
but have different cures
similar injuries
but opposite remedies
after our love ended
your arms don't carry me
without love i feel the abyss
understand your fear of death
i will not forget
this notget
will you not regret
having love let go?
after our love ended
your spirit entered me
now we are the guardians
we'll keep her safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
safe, safe from...
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death

genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
so warm
sounds go through the muscles
these abstract, wordless movements
move, move, move, move, move
they start off cells that haven't been touched before
these cells are virgins
waking up slowly waking up
waking up slowly wake up
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
nothing will be the same
i'm asleep
i'm fast asleep
i like this resonance
it elevates me
i don't recognise myself
this is very interesting
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
i'm fast asleep now
you're still with me
i'm fast asleep
i'm asleep
my headphones
they saved, saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

i shuffle around the tectonic plates in my chest
you know i gave it all
try to match our continents
to change seasonal shift
to form a mutual core
as fast as your fingernail grows
the atlantic ridge drifts
to counteract distance
you know i gave it all
can you hear the effort
of the magnetic strife?
shuffling of columns
to form a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
you hid the key to our continuity
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know
what you resist persists
nuance makes heat
to counteract distance
i know you gave it all
offered me harmony
if things were done your way
my eurasian plate subsumed
forming a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know i had it in me
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know


====================
show me forgiveness
i've seen it all
you betrayed your own people
you've betrayed your own tribe
you've betrayed your own home
you've betrayed your own home
you've betrayed your own home
your tribe is cold
it feels like death
i'm trying to heal
a wound that was cold
still heals
i'm trying to heal
a wound that was warm
warm in my chest
a glimpse of hope
a glimpse of hope
a glimpse of hope
i remember
weaves our species
we grow slow-mo
riding chariots
driving wonder
i remember
when i first met you
rides a horse with four minds
he cuts loose from constraints
he invents new ways to struggle
i remember
the pleasure is now all mine
leaves a lasting impression
i'm not passing up the chance
to connect with you tonight
perhaps i'll take you on the chin
and i can rest easy knowing
we are one people
one people
one mind
one foot soldier
our hearts are strong
our minds are strong
but our hearts are strong
our hearts are strong
we are one people
one minds, one imaginations
but the impression we've had
has been a whirlwind for us
mostly us
we were girls
lately
i've been sucked into a life
mostly us
girls go to parties
mostly of us
we were all alone
mostly of us
lately
i've been sending out e-mails
reading novels
reading magazines
reading cookbooks
reading cookbooks
all to yourself
it's just another musical
music can change the sky
let's open the floodgates
love is a cold black egg
i'm trying my best to make it right
but there's still some left
to be found
the sky is dark and gloomy
i'm trying my best to make it right
but there's still some left

the sky is dark and gloomy
i'm trying my best to make it right
but there's still some left

you think you're denying me of something
well, i've got plenty
you're the one who's missing out

you have to take responsibility
one-on-one
with you

what's the least bit responsible
for your daughter's death
and for her death to be a traumatic time
you and i grew up together
it wasn't meant to be a tragedy
it was meant to be a wonderful mystery
you and i grew up together
it wasn't meant to be a strife
we had a bright future ahead of us
and if you let it slip
that you don't mind me asking
i look after you
i dress nicely for you
i play nice with you
i play nice with you
you're my second option
i go around and grab a coffee
or a slice of bread
or a slice of bread
for me to grab
for you to handle
this is an emergency
i'm throwing myself at you
and i may or may not get hurt
i don't know the full implications
i don't know what to do
and i don't know how to react
how i wish to turn you around
how i wish to turn you around

come to me
i'll take care of you
protect you
calm, calm down
you're exhausted
come lie down
you don't have to explain
i understand
you know that i adore you
you know that i love you
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm
jump off
your building's on fire

i wake up
and the day feels a-broken
i tilt my head
i'm trying to get an angle
'cause the evening
i've always longed for
it could still happen
how do i master
the perfect day
six glasses of water
seven phone calls
if you leave it alone
it might just happen
anyway
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
well it never really was
it's not up to you

there's too much
clinging

there's too much

she always knows when people need stroking
and is attracted to deathbeds and divorces
i dreamt she cared for my dying grandfather
lying naked face down on his bed
she insists on total presence
and knows how to get through to the rest of us
she has entered me thousandfold often
and undone knots at my most awkward
music, music loves too
she reaches out to orphans and refugees
embraces them with thermal blankets
her favourite childhood moments
were at a hospital for the disabled
i've seen her offer empathy to widows
she attends funerals of strangers
her strongest memory
is feeding children with leprosy
music heals too
i'm here to defend it

through the downcast lashes
i see the tears
i see the light up
now i have to sort it all out
do it now!
no one wants to know

i travel the world
finding kindred spirits
resting
like a virus
on the wrong body
patient at the same

how can i make the right decision?
how do i make the right decision?
and i gather courage to share
who you are, who you are

when you're ready to leave
your phone off
i'll catch you
call me when i'm warm
and i'll catch you

get over the sorrow, girl
the world is always going to be made of this
you can trust in it
unless you breathe in
bravely
i adore how you simply surrender to high
and your lungs, they're mourning
t-b style
all the stillborn love that could've happened
all the moments you should have embraced
all the moments you should have not locked up
understand so clearly:
to shut yourself up
would be the hugest crime of them all
hugest crime of them all
you're just crying after all
to not want them humans around
anymore
get over that sorrow, girl
get over it

one touch, but one touch directly

if you ever get close to a human
and human behaviour
be ready, be ready to get confused
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic

but yet so, yet so irresistible
and there is no map
they're terribly, terribly, terribly moody
oh, human behaviour
then all of a sudden turn happy
but, oh, to get involved in the exchange
of human emotions
is ever so, ever so satisfying
and there is no map

when you're alone and life is making you lonely
you can always go downtown
when you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
seems to help, i know downtown
just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
how can you lose?
the lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
so go downtown
things'll be great when you're downtown
no finer place, for sure, downtown
everything's waiting for you
don't hang around and let your problems surround you
there are movie shows downtown
maybe you know some little places to go to
where they never close downtown
just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
you'll be dancing with him too before the night is over
happy again
the lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
so go downtown
where all the lights are bright downtown
waiting for you tonight downtown
you're gonna be all right now
and you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
guide them along
so maybe i'll see you there
we can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares
so go downtown
things'll be great when you're downtown
don't wait a minute for downtown
everything's waiting for you

come on girl
let's sneak out of this party
it's getting boring
there's more to life than this
it's still early morning
we could go down to the harbor
and jump between the boats
and see the sun come up
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life

you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
we could nick a boat
and sneak off to this island
i could bring my little ghetto blaster
there's more to life than this
but we'd have to rush back
to the town's best
====================
there is yet another one
that follows me
wherever i go
and supports me
all this tooth is warmth-like
this tooth is warmth-like
this tooth is warmth-like
like rain or shine
i can feel it
it's all there
in the hole
in the bottom
of the hole
cold and closed
rocks as ancient as our fingers
we are all here
and we're exploring
what's inside us
isnt up to you
it's all up to you
this is where you are
is where you are
we are each other
it's a mountain peak
lessons learnt
got the hang of it all
and if you ever get close
you'll meet a beauty
that is different
from ourselves
and that is something
you have to manage
i won't let you get distracted
this is an uphill climb
it's not meant to be a downhill
it's not meant to be a uphill
it's not meant to be a hopscotched spine
to be rude, rudely rude
it's not meant to be a rudderless kiwi
it's not meant to be a lynx parading
it's not meant to be a lynx like us
it's not meant to be a trouble spot
it's not meant to be a town to be missed
and if you ever get close
you'll meet a beauty
that is different
from ourselves
and that is something
you have to manage
get off my lawn fast
this is an uphill climb
it's not meant to be a downhill
it's not meant to be a uphill
it's not meant to be a uphill
it's not meant to be a rudderless kiwi
it's not meant to be a a trapeze walk
it's not meant to be a semisafety zone
for if i lose my cool and jump off
i lose my footing and fall down the steps
this is an uphill climb
it's not meant to be a downhill
it's not meant to be a uphill
it's not meant to be a downhill
it's not meant to be a downhill
it's not meant to be a downhill
it's not meant to be a downhill from here
to the finish
i will be on my own
without me
and if you doubt my abilities
i'm not pitenting
it's not meant to be as noisy
as this
this is serious
and if you doubt my musical
sounds
realize
it will be real soon
i'm on my own
and if you doubt my musical
sounds
realize
it will be real soon
this is my own universe

black night is falling
the sun is gone to bed
the innocent are dreaming
as you should, sleepy-head
sleepy-head, sleepy-head:
all the love above
i send into you
comfort and protection
i'll watch over you
but don't ask me
what's gonna happen next
i know the future
i'd love to lead you the way
just to make it easier on you
you are gonna have to find out for yourself
you are gonna have to find out for yourself
you are gonna have to find out for yourself
you are gonna have to find out for yourself
my dearest scatterheart
there is comfort
right in the eye
of the hurricane
just to make it easier on you
you are gonna have to find out for yourself
you are gonna have to find out for yourself
you are gonna have to find out for yourself
you are gonna have to find out for yourself
all the hurt in the world
you know
there's nothing i'd love to do more
than spare you from that burden
it's gonna be hard
if i only could
shelter you
from that pain
just to make it easier on you
you are gonna have to find out for yourself

train-whistles, a sweet clementine
blueberries, dancers in line
cobwebs, a bakery sign
oh - a sweet clementine
oh - dancers in line
oh
if living is seeing
i'm holding my breath
in wonder - i wonder
what happens next?
a new world, a new day to see
see, see
i'm softly walking on air
halfway to heaven from here
sunlight unfolds in my hair
oh - i'm walking on air
oh - to heaven from here
oh
if living is seeing
i'm holding my breath
in wonder - i wonder
what happens next?
a new world, a new day to see

he means tomorrow but says, "in a bit"

down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is where i'm staying
this is my home

one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it will all come true
one day
when you're ready
one day, one day
when you're up to it
the atmosphere
will get lighter
and two suns ready
to shine just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it will all make sense
one day
you will blossom
one day, one day
when you're ready
an aeroplane
will curve gracefully
around the volcano
with the eruption that never lets you down
i can feel it
i can feel it
and the beautifullest
fireworks are burning
in the sky, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh
just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
it will all come true
one day
one day, one day

genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
so warm
sounds go through the muscles
these abstract, wordless movements
move, move, move, move, move
they start off cells that haven't been touched before
these cells are virgins
waking up slowly waking up
waking up slowly wake up
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
nothing will be the same
i'm asleep
i'm fast asleep
i like this resonance
it elevates me
i don't recognise myself
this is very interesting
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
i'm fast asleep now
you're still with me
i'm fast asleep
i'm asleep
my headphones
they saved, saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

i shuffle around the tectonic plates in my chest
you know i gave it all
try to match our continents
to change seasonal shift
to form a mutual core
as fast as your fingernail grows
the atlantic ridge drifts
to counteract distance
you know i gave it all
can you hear the effort
of the magnetic strife?
shuffling of columns
to form a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
you hid the key to our continuity
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know
what you resist persists
nuance makes heat
to counteract distance
i know you gave it all
offered me harmony
if things were done your way
my eurasian plate subsumed
forming a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know
====================
and you're all alone
i'm not taming no animal
maybe i'll catch you
and take you back
or, maybe not
maybe i'll catch you
and take you back
or, maybe not
maybe i'll catch you
and take you back
or, maybe not

arisen, alarm-call!

down the corridor
i sit cross-legged
reading a beautiful old romance
down the staircase
i play devil's advocate

things so far have been too perfect

i've been through

oh thou that bowest
thy ecstatic face
thy perfect sorrows
are the world's to keep
wherefore onto thy knees
come weep
with a prayer
oh thou that bowest
thy ecstatic face
thy perfect sorrows
are the world's to keep
wherefore onto thy knees
come weep
with a prayer
mother heroic
mother glorious
beholding in thy eyes
immortal tears

thy ecstatic face

sunday is gloomy, the hours are slumberless
dearest of shadows i live with are numberless
little white flowers will never awaken you
not where the dark coach of sorrow has taken you
angels have no thought of ever returning you
would they be angry if i thought of joining you?
gloomy sunday
gloomy sunday, with shadows i spend it all
my heart and i have decided to end it all
soon there'll be prayers and candles are lit, i know
let them not weep, let them know that i'm glad to go
death is a dream, for in death i'm caressing you
with the last breath of my soul, i'll be blessing you
gloomy sunday
dreaming
i was only dreaming
i awake and i find you asleep and deep in my heart
dear
darling, i hope that my dream hasn't haunted you
my heart is telling you how much i wanted you
gloomy sunday
it's absolutely gloomy sunday
gloomy sunday
sunday

i
====================
and then i go away
i go away
and then i go away
safe away from this darkness
safe away from this darkness
safe away from this darkness
safe away from this darkness
safe away from this darkness
safe away from this darkness
safe away from this...
safe away from this darkness
safe away from this...
safe away from this...

all those boys
who said they wanted to be artists
and then they couldn't
and then i say i want to be artists
and then i say i want to be artists
and then i say i want to be artists
i don't know my future after this
and i don't want to
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
i don't know my future after this
and i don't want to
i don't want to
i don't want to
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
i don't know my future after this
after this dream i took this vow
i didn't know what i would do next
this dream was wild
i didn't know what i would do
this was gonna be easy
i know what i'd do
i didn't know what i would do
this was gonna be really, really, really, really, really, really, really
i wouldn't know what i'd do
i wouldn't know what i'd do
this was gonna be easy
just another hard time crunch
of 'em
with 'em
sometimes the less room you give yourself
the more room you give yourself
i'm not stopping
you're holding me
you're pushing me down
you're trying to tilt me
you're suggesting a different approach
i'm gonna have to break this down
for you
you're trying to get where you are
you're offering me resistance
it's not up to you
you're trying to get me to open up
you're suggesting a different approach
i'm not stopping
you're trying to get me to, say, open up
you're suggesting a different approach
i'm trying to get you to give yourself more space
you're trying to get us to give you more space
you're trying to get us to give you more space
what's the lesser of two evils
if a suicide bomber made to look pregnant
manages to kill her target or not?
what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if she kills them or dies in vain?
nature has fixed no limits on our hopes
oh, what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if her bump was fake or if it was real?
here's my version of it
eternal whirlwind
i have fostered since childhood
well, i don't care
love is all
i dare to drown
to be proven wrong

when your eyes pause on the ball
that hangs on the third branch from the star
you remember why it is dark
and why it gets light again
the earth, like the heart, slopes in its seat
and, like that, it travels along an elliptical path
drawn into the darkness
an unpolished pearl
in sky-black palm of hand
flickering sun-flame
and then you remember
that you, yourself, you are a light-bearer, a light-bearer
receiving radiance from others
flickering sun-flame
unpolished earth in palm of hand

show me forgiveness
for having lost faith in myself
and let my own interior up
to inferior forces
the shame is endless
but if soon start forgiveness
the girl might live

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
i see who you are
i see who you.... are...

it may not always be so
and i say that if your lips
which i have loved
should touch another's
and your dear strong fingers clutch her heart
as mine in time not far away
if on another's face your sweet hair lay
in such a silence as i know
or such great writhing words as, uttering
====================
and these steps
i'm paralysed by these feelings
but the intentions are pure
and the solutions are hidden
i trussed them up
in ribbon of leaves
wanderlust! from island to island
iwanderlust!
iwanderlust!
iwanderlust!
iwanderlust!

sólin sekkur
====================
i know this is a long post, but i hope i've put it lightly
you've got yourself in a fine mess there, then
there is little doubt in my mind
that the above was all just a dream
a few moments of me blissing you up
then suddenly my deepest wish
shuffling your beak
into the air massaging it
i shall be pearl by pearl
polka by polka
polka by polka
i am strong in both worlds
i am strong in both worlds
but enough is enough
i am strong in both worlds
and the physicality of them all
i am strong in both worlds
and the physicality of them all

we are each other's children
we are each other's children
we are each other's children
let's open up now
so i may love you
so i may love you
so i may love you
i mustn'tn't, shouldn't she do the crying?
baby, don't cry
let it off
so i may love you
so i may love you
so i may love you
i mustn't, shouldn't she do the crying?
baby, don't cry
let it off
so i may love you
so i may love you
so i may love you
baby, don't cry

through the downcast lashes
i can feel you
burning
i can feel you
is all the time i have
forgive me
i'm sorry i broke your heart
i'm sorry you're crying
i'm praying for her
not 'til it's too late
but when i see her light up
i'll be all right
and there's nothing wrong
i'll be all right
and the world to see
just another tale
of sunshine
just another tale
of sunshine
just another tale
of kisses
just another tale
of love
just another tale
of love
just another tale
of love
just another tale
of love
just another tale
of love
just another tale
of love
just another tale
of love
i see you, i see you
you, you, you
you're the intruder
hold tight
keep your head down
there's more to life
there's more to life than this
you know that there's more to life

gloomy sunday
my heart's burned
gloomy sunday
my heart's burned
but then it gets dark
i'm dressed lightly
i walk towards the edge of the town
slowly unravels
in a tower of steel
grey fog creeps slowly over the hill
its not hard to see where i'm going
all this soil is yielding
all this soil is yielding
all this soil is yielding
i'm going to this forest for love
this fucking jungle ain't quieting
you can hear the thumping of thrones
and thumping hearts
it will quiet the dull flame
i'm going to this island to stay
this fucking jungle ain't quieting
you can hear the thumping of thrones
and thumping hearts
it will quiet the dull flame
i'm going to this island to stay

i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down to the bottom of the bay
underneath the waves
using every bit of it
to my surprise
i land softly
on my best behaviour
missable
unfortunate
i never thought i would compromise
this is a great place to be
home
i play nice
with plastic
and set off alarms
i tune my alarm
the parts are what they are
use those parts as a musical base
music for the mouth
and the mouth, the parts are what they are

i adapt to changing circumstances
i find comfort in being vulnerable
this is an alarm-call-er
i seek solace in being vulnerable
this is a musical version of the prayer
the parts are what they are
music for the mouth
but enough
is enough
i seek solace in being vulnerable
this is a musical version of the prayer
the parts are what they are
music for the mouth
but enough
is enough
i seek solace in being vulnerable
this is a musical version of the prayer
the parts are what they are
music for the mouth
but enough
is enough
let's open up: share!
we are a small town
where the boho dance is
listen here:

your saintly voice

let's open up: share!
please share this song with the following people:
religion, sex, race
religion, sex, sex

love yourself, love yourself now!
reliably

relately

while you are away
my heart comes undone
slowly unravels
in a ball of yarn
the devil collects it
with a grin
our love
in a ball of yarn

you assigned me to protect our lantern
to be intentional about the light

my instinct has been shouting at me for years

huge toxic tumour bulging underneath the ground here

first snow of winter
i'm walking hills and valleys
adore this
====================
it's too late
you can't say no to hope
you can't say no to happiness
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
it's not meant to be a strife

oh i
unravel

when i spot someone who is same height as you
and goes to same record stores
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
when i hear someone with same accent as yours
asking directions with the same beard as yours
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
isn't it odd?
isn't it peculiar?
these statistics of my mind
shuffling your features
assembling a man
googling love
warming my heart on this log fire of love
features creatures
features creatures
features creatures
features creatures
his orifices
his orifices

i can sense it
something important
is about to happen
it's coming up
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
we just met
and i know i'm a bit too intimate
but something huge is coming up
and we're both included
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
i don't know my future after this weekend
and i don't want to
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality, sensuality

he turned me down, i then downturned another
who then downturned her
the paralyzing juice of rejection
his veins full of lead
he's left with loving what he lost
more than what he has
my snakeskin cold in the dark
but warms up in the light
i then upturned a green eyed giant
who upturned and entered me
will we stop seeing what unites us
but only what differs?
the ghosts of old loves
hovering around his orifices, his orifices...
as you narrate your own hearttale
you thread souls into one beam
the love you gave and have been given
weave into your own dream
i trust my cells to rearchive
my love historic stream

threading
the glacier head
looking hard for
moments of shine
from twilight
to twilight
aurora
ahh-ahh
uhh-uhh
ahh-uhh
aurora
goddess sparkle
shoot me
beyond this suffer
the need
is great
aurora
ahh-ahh
uhh-uhh
ahh-uhh
aurora
goddess sparkle
a mountain shade
suggests your shape
i tumbled down
on my knees
fill the mouth
with snow
the way it melts
i wish
to melt
into you

i've seen it all, i have seen the trees
i've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
i've seen a man killed by his best friend
and lives that were over before they were spent
i've seen what i was — i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru!
i'm happy to say i had better to do
what about china? have you seen the great wall?
all walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!
and the man you will marry?
the home you will share?
to be honest, i really don't care...
you've never been to niagara falls?
i have seen water, it's water, that's all...
the eiffel tower, the empire state?
my pulse was as high on my very first date!
your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?
to be honest, i really don't care...
i've seen it all, i've seen the dark
i've seen the brightness in one little spark
i've seen what i chose and i've seen what i need
and that is enough, to want more would be greed
i've seen what i was and i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you've seen it all and all you have seen
you can always review on your own

we all have a fascination with
the ancient sea
carnivorous
but the charm of it all
is, if a ship sinks
and all is lost
it will be impossible to find survivors
and if you find survivors, then so be it
you are the fisherman
looking for survivors
relentless by instinct
we are the swiftmen
flowing with life
you and me
we're the strongest
you and me
we're the strongest
you and me
we're the strongest
you and me
you're the strongest
you and me
you're the strongest

first snow of winter
i'm walking hills and valleys
adore this mystical fog!
this fucking mist!
these cliffs are just showing off!
then the body memory kicks in
i mime my home mountains
the moss that i'm made of
i redeem myself
i've been wrestling my fate
do i accept this ending?
will i accept my death
or struggle claustrophobic?
fought like a wolverine
with my destiny
refuse to accept what was meant to be
then the body memory kicks in
and i trust the unknown
unfathomable imagination
surrender to future
oh, how to capture all this love
and find a pathway for it
like threading an ocean through a needle
river through a keyhole
can't fathom the grasp
i can't grasp the fathom
then my body memory kicks in
my limbs and tongue take over
like the ancestors before me
show me the flow
my sexual dna
x-rays of my kama sutras
summons different bodies
compares spines and buttocks
and back of necks
then my body memory kicks in
it simply takes over
bestiality
i redeem my body
i wasn't born urban
toxic doesn't agree with me
love lured me here
into a stagnant state
my myths, my customs, ridiculed
vacuum packed molecules
then my body memory kicks in
on this brooklyn dance floor
sweating with these rhythms
rotate this matrix
all trapped in legal harness
kafkaesque
farce like patriarchy
avoided to confront it
then the body memory kicks in
my warrior awakens
my turn to defend
urban didn't tame me
then my body memory kicks in
all bosoms and embraces
oral, anal entrances
enjoy the satisfaction
if the other is growing

who would have known
that a boy like him
would have entered me lightly
restoring my blisses?
who would have known
that a boy like him
after sharing my core
would stay going nowhere?
who would have known
a beauty this immense?
who would have known
a saintly trance?
who would have known
miraculous breath?
to inhale a beard
loaded with courage
who would have known
that a boy like him
possessed of magical
sensitivity?
who would approach a girl like me
who caresses, cradles his head
in her bosom?
he slides inside
half awake, half asleep
we faint back
into sleephood
when i wake up
====================
it's real early morning
no one is awake
i'm back at my cliff
still throwing things off
i listen to sounds they make
on their way down
i follow with my eyes till they crash
i imagine what my body would sound like
slamming against those rocks
and when it lands
will my eyes be closed or open?
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you

get over the sorrow, girl
the world is always going to be made of this
you can trust in it
unless you breathe in
bravely
i adore how you simply surrender to high
and your lungs, they're mourning
t-b style
all the stillborn love that could've happened
all the moments you should have embraced
all the moments you should have not locked up
understand so clearly:
to shut yourself up
would be the hugest crime of them all
hugest crime of them all
you're just crying after all
to not want them humans around
anymore
get over that sorrow, girl
get over it

hollow
my ancestors have access
hollow
i'm falling down the abyss
hollow
looking for some answers
generations of mothers sailing in
somehow they all were shipfolks
hollow
the ground is opening up
swallows me up
the trunk of dna
the trunk of dna, trunk
now come forth, all species
hollow
like a bead in necklace
thread me upon this chain
i'm part of it, ohh
the everlasting necklace
jewels after jewels after jewels after
jewels after jewels after jewels
i yearn to belong
let me belong
let me belong

up on the toe
there is a view
up on the toe
and the spine
straight and erect
hungry and curious
up on the toe
looking forward to
the air is thinner here
she came here
to lose face
got down on her knees
the beast is back!
on four legs
set her clock to the moon
raises her spine
vertebrae by vertebrae
up on the toe
looking
i have been filled with steam for months, for years
same old cloud, claustrophobic me
let it burst like old train sounds
make them leave me nature
vertebrae by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
my arms ooze out of my shoulders!
and the arms ooze out of my shoulders
i curl my tail inwards, inwards
i set my clock on the moon
vertebrae by vertebrae
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
let off some steam

here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind
here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind
here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind
what's the lesser of two evils
if a suicide bomber made to look pregnant
manages to kill her target or not?
what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if she kills them or dies in vain?
nature has fixed no limits on our hopes
oh, what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if her bump was fake or if it was real?
here's my version of it
eternal whirlwind
i have fostered since childhood
well, i don't care
love is all
i dare to drown
to be proven wrong

when your eyes pause on the ball
that hangs on the third branch from the star
you remember why it is dark
and why it gets light again
the earth, like the heart, slopes in its seat
and, like that, it travels along an elliptical path
drawn into the darkness
an unpolished pearl
in sky-black palm of hand
flickering sun-flame
and then you remember
that you, yourself, you are a light-bearer, a light-bearer
receiving radiance from others
flickering sun-flame
unpolished earth in palm of hand

show me forgiveness
for having lost faith in myself
and let my own interior up
to inferior forces
the shame is endless
but if soon start forgiveness
the girl might live

your third-class communication
and bulldoze over all my sensitivities

sunday is gloomy, the hours are slumberless
dearest of shadows i live with are numberless
little white flowers will never awaken you
not where the dark coach of sorrow has taken you
angels have no thought of ever returning you
would they be angry if i thought of joining you?
gloomy sunday
gloomy sunday

i am not saying this is an accident
i am saying that i am happy with the state of my health
and the state of my health right now
i am suggesting that you approach this situation with open arms
sunday is gloomy and i have little doubt that you will wake up
i'mamnotlyingitself in doubt
i wish to sound ungrateful, ungracious
but there's no need to be boastful either
you've got to treat all this well
you've got to treat all that you say well
you've got to treat all that you give well
you've got to treat all that you give well
i'm trying my best to help you

if you ever get close to a human

be ready, be ready to get confused
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic

the words i slowly put together
do not flow easily, they only fill my heart
recently, fulfilling
your heart's desire
you removed the whaling
moratorium
your gesture brings
a much needed food
to our community
and families
the words i slowly put together
do not flow easily, they only fill my heart
a million year old fossil
i send to you
this comes from my family
and the ancient sea
a prehistoric impression
of the modern krill
she feeds the noble whale
and offers you longevity
the words i slowly put together
do not flow easily, they only fill my heart
finally, please take good care in the heat
sincerely yours

it's wet in the middle
with a shell around it
it's called "life"
it goes wherever it wants to

she always knows when people need stroking
and is attracted to deathbeds and divorces
i dreamt she cared for my dying grandfather
lying naked face down on his bed
she insists on total presence
and knows how to get through to the rest of us
she has entered me thousandfold often
and undone knots at my most awkward
music, music loves too
she reaches out to orphans and refugees
embraces them with thermal blankets
her favourite childhood moments
were at a hospital for the disabled
i've seen her offer empathy to widows
she attends funerals of strangers
her strongest memory
is feeding children with leprosy
music heals too
i'm here to defend it

you have done good for yourselves
since you left my care
and crawled ashore
to the shore
where my little ghetto
is run amok
you are strong
but there's a charm that is greater still:
when my love's eyes are lowered
when all is fired by passions kiss
and through the downcast lashes
i see the dull flame of desire
and through the downcast lashes
i see the dull flame of desire

their splendid, sparkling fire
when suddenly you raise them so
to cast a swift embracing glance

the nerves are sending shimmering signals
all through my fingers
the veins support
blood that gushes impulsively towards
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the stubborn trunks of these legs of mine
serve as pathways for my favourite fuel
heading upwards towards my kidneys
that celebrate
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
smooth soft red velvety lungs
are pushing a network of oxygen joyfully
through a nose, through a mouth
but all enjoys, all enjoys
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart

it's tricky when
you feel someone
has done something
on your behalf
it's slippery when
your sense of justice
murmurs underneath
and is asking you:
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
with a palm full of stars
i throw them like dice repeatedly
on the table repeat, repeatedly
i shake them like dice
and throw them on the table
repeatedly repeatedly
until the desired constellation appears
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
and you hear: how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?

day after day
alone on a hill
the strange guy
where the rooster crowed
no one wants to know about him
and they point where he goes
he still holds out alone
do you know about a fool on a hill
he can see a precious sun
and his eyes see more
they see a world, a hidden world
ask him for help
he comes quickly
he that has thousand voices
whisper the truth quickly
no one wants to listen to him
or the sound in a secret song
which he doesn't know at all
do you know about a fool on a hill
no one wants to see him
in the hut in the south with a lake
he still holds out alone

no one wants to listen to him
and they point where he goes
he still holds out alone

down in the cellar in the boho zone
i went looking for some sweet inspiration, oh well
just another hard time band with negro affectations
i was a hopeful in rooms like this
when i was working cheap
it's an old romance, the boho dance
hasn't gone to sleep
but even on the scuffle
the cleaner's press was in my jeans
and any eye for detail
caught a little lace along the seams
and you were in the parking lot
subterranean by your own design
the virtue of your style inscribed
on your contempt for mine
jesus was a beggar, he was rich in grace
and solomon kept

when i spot someone who is same height as you
and goes to same record stores
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
when i hear someone with same accent as yours
asking directions with the same beard as yours
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
isn't it odd?
isn't it peculiar?
these statistics of my mind
shuffling your features
assembling a man
googling love
warming my heart on this log fire of love
features creatures

i can sense it
something important
is about to happen
it's coming up
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
we just met
and i know i'm a bit too intimate
but something huge is coming up
and we're both included
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
i don't know my future after this weekend
and i don't want to
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality, sensuality

he turned me down, i then downturned another
who then downturned her
the paralyzing juice of rejection
his veins full of lead
he's left with loving what he lost
more than what he has
my snakeskin cold in the dark
but warms up in the light
i then upturned a green eyed giant
who upturned and entered me
will we stop seeing what unites us
but only what differs?
the ghosts of old loves
hovering around his orifices, his orifices...
as you narrate your own hearttale
you thread souls into one beam
the love you gave and have been given
weave into your own dream
i trust my cells to rearchive
my love historic stream

threading

looking hard for
moments of shine

i've seen it all, i have seen the trees
i've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
i've seen a man killed by his best friend
and lives that were over before they were spent
i've seen what i was — i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru!
i'm happy to say i had better to do
what about china? have you seen the great wall?
all walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!
and the man you will marry?
the home you will share?

i once had no fears
none at all
and then when
i had some
to my surprise
i grew to like both
scared or brave
without them
the thrill of fear
thought i'd never admit it
the thrill of fear
now greatly enjoyed with courage
when i once was
untouchable
innocence roared
still amazes
when i once was
innocent
it is still here

fear is a powerful drug
overcome it and
you think that you can do
anything

save myself
for later
or generously give?
fear of
losing
energy
is draining
it locks up your chest
shuts down the heart
miserly
and stingy

and the man comes on the radio
so I quickly refocus
the sky is the limit
and the words i say get me out of that city
there are words that i can use to deal with you
but only ones that i can handle
the beauty in numbers
the man is persistent
his message is clear
and the words i say get me out of that city
there are words that i can use to deal with you
but only ones that i can handle
the beauty in numbers
the beauty in numbers
the beauty in numbers
say those words to me and i will obey
and i'll get what i're given
the beauty in numbers
the beauty in numbers
the beauty in numbers
words that i say get me out of that city
there are words that i can use to deal with you
but only ones that i can handle
the beauty in numbers
the beauty in numbers
the beauty in numbers
those words are the same as those i've been given
words that i can use to deal with you
i'm strong in his hands: in his hands i'm strong
in his hands i'm strong
again: take me under your wing
again: take me under your wing
again: take me under your wing
i'll protect you: i'll protect you
again: take me under your wing
again: take me under your wing

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
and enjoy every bit of you
of you
i see who you are
i see who you... are...

we live on a mountain
right at the top
there's a beautiful view
from the top of themountain
everymorning i walktowards the edge
and throw little thingsoff
like car parts, bottles and cutlery
or whatever i find lying around
it's become a habit
a way to start the day
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
it's real early morning
no one is awake
i'm back at my cliff
still throwing things off
i listen to sounds they make
on their way down
i follow with my eyes till they crash
i imagine what my body would sound like
slamming against those rocks
and when it lands
will my eyes be closed or open?
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you

in a forest pitch-dark
glowed the tiniest spark
it burst into a flame
like me, like me
my nameisobel

my loveisobel
living by herself
in a heart fullof dust
lives a creature called lust
it surprises and scares
like me, like me
my name isobel
married to myself
my love isobel
living by herself
crawling in silence, a simple excuse
in a tower of steel
nature forges a deal
to raise wonderful hell
like me, like me

my heart is so broken

trying to run ahead of that
heart-break-train
thinking
it will never catch up with me
i'm so broken

i'm trying to land
this aeroplane of ours gracefully
but it seems just destined to crash
i'm so broken
heðan-biður-afte-care
my heart is so broken

how can, how can
i sense all continuity just vanish away?
at one step at a time now baby

get over the sorrow, girl
the world is always going to be made of this
you can trust in it
unless you breathe in
bravely
i adore how you simply surrender to high
and your lungs, they're mourning
t-b style
all the stillborn love that could've happened
all the moments you should have embraced
all the moments you should have not locked up
understand so clearly:
to shut yourself up
would be the hugest crime of them all
hugest crime of them all
you're just crying after all
to not want them humans around
anymore
get over that sorrow, girl
get over it

hollow
my ancestors have access
hollow
i'm falling down the abyss
hollow
looking for some answers
generations of mothers sailing in
somehow they all were shipfolks
hollow
the ground is opening up
swallows me up
the trunk of dna
the trunk of dna, trunk
now come forth, all species
hollow
like a bead in necklace
thread me upon this chain
i'm part of it, ohh
the everlasting necklace
jewels after jewels after jewels after
jewels after jewels after jewels
i yearn to belong
let me belong
let me belong

up on the toe
there is a view
up on the toe
and the spine
straight and erect
hungry and curious
up on the toe
looking forward to
the air is thinner here
she came here
to lose face
got down on her knees
the beast is back!
on four legs
set her clock to the moon
raises her spine
vertebrae by vertebrae
up on the toe
looking
i have been filled with steam for months, for years
same old cloud, claustrophobic me
let it burst like old train sounds
make them leave me nature
vertebrae by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
my arms ooze out of my shoulders!
and the arms ooze out of my shoulders
i curl my tail inwards, inwards
i set my clock on the moon
vertebrae by vertebrae
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
let off some steam

when i spot someone who is same height as you
and goes to same record stores
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
when i hear someone with same accent as yours
asking directions with the same beard as yours
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
isn't it odd?
isn't it peculiar?
these statistics of my mind
shuffling your features
assembling a man
googling love
warming my heart on this log fire of love
features creatures
features creatures
features creatures
features creatures
his orifices
his orifices

i can sense it
something important
is about to happen
it's coming up
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
we just met
and i know i'm a bit too intimate
but something huge is coming up
and we're both included
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
i don't know my future after this weekend
and i don't want to
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality, sensuality

he turned me down, i then downturned another
who then downturned her
the paralyzing juice of rejection
his veins full of lead
he's left with loving what he lost
more than what he has
my snakeskin cold in the dark
but warms up in the light
i then upturned a green eyed giant
who upturned and entered me
will we stop seeing what unites us
but only what differs?
the ghosts of old loves
hovering around his orifices, his orifices...
as you narrate your own hearttale
you thread souls into one beam
the love you gave and have been given
weave into your own dream
i trust my cells to rearchive
my love historic stream

threading
the glacier head
looking hard for
moments of shine
from twilight
to twilight

shoot me
beyond this suffer
the need
is great

a mountain shade
suggests your shape
i tumbled down
on my knees
fill the mouth
with snow
the way it melts
i wish
to melt
into you
aurora

ahh-uhh
spark the sun off
spark the sun off
spark the sun off
spark the sun off for me

i've seen it all, i have seen the trees
i've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
i've seen a man killed by his best friend
and lives that were over before they were spent
i've seen what i was — i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru!
i'm happy to say i had better to do

you're trying too hard

i have a recurrent dream
every time i lose my voice
i swallow little glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me
during the nights
they do a trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above my bed
while i'm asleep
my mother and son pour into me
warm glowing oil
into my wide open throat
i have a recurrent dream
every time i feel a hoarseness
i swallow warm glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me, oh
they make me feel so much better
they make me feel better
we have a recurrent dream
every time we lose our voices
we dream we swallow little lights
our mother and son bakes for us
during the nights

while you are away
my heart comes undone
slowly unravels
in a ball of yarn
the devil collects it
with a grin
our love
in a ball of yarn
he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love
he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love

====================
i know i'm small
but if you asked me five years ago, my jaw would have fallen out
wirelessly snapping my fingers
look no further
for in these palm trees
nature has enabled
hermit style
lulled to me
the forest has opened up
swallows me up
the trunk of the tree erect
legs no longer bound
declares independence
now we stand before the universe
unfold, trunk erect
domestically
i.e. unconditionally
anyone who ever had a heart
would then release me
flickering sun-flame
into the air a reindeer-like creature
aurorora
flickering sun-flame
would then return fire
with a vengeance
flickering sun-flame
into the air a reindeer-like creature

get over the sorrow, girl
the world is always going to be made of this
you can trust in it
unless you breathe in
bravely
i adore how you simply surrender to high
and your lungs, they're mourning
t-b style
all the stillborn love that could've happened
all the moments you should have embraced
all the moments you should have not locked up
understand so clearly:
to shut yourself up
would be the hugest crime of them all
hugest crime of them all
you're just crying after all
to not want them humans around
anymore

shuffling your features

something important

it's coming up
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
we just met
and i know i'm a bit too intimate
but something huge is coming up
and we're both included
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
i don't know my future after this weekend
and i don't want to
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality, sensuality

he turned me down, i then downturned another
who then downturned her
the paralyzing juice of rejection
his veins full of lead
he's left with loving what he lost
more than what he has
my snakeskin cold in the dark
but warms up in the light
i then upturned a green eyed giant
who upturned and entered me
will we stop seeing what unites us
but only what differs?
the ghosts of old loves
hovering around his orifices, his orifices...
as you narrate your own hearttale
you thread souls into one beam
the love you gave and have been given
weave into your own dream
i trust my cells to rearchive
my love historic stream

threading

looking hard for
moments of shine
from twilight

when your eyes pause on the ball
that hangs on the third branch from the star
you remember why it is dark
and why it gets light again
the earth, like the heart, slopes in its seat
and, like that, it travels along an elliptical path
drawn into the darkness
an unpolished pearl
in sky-black palm of hand
flickering sun-flame
and then you remember
that you, yourself, you are a light-bearer, a light-bearer
receiving radiance from others
flickering sun-flame
unpolished earth in palm of hand

in a forest pitch-dark
glowed the tiniest spark
it burst into a flame
like me, like me
wanderlust!

my heart is so broken

it will never catch up with me
i'm so broken

this aeroplane of ours gracefully

i'm so broken

====================
we can start the day with a kiss
and remember to bring your own lantern
it will be the sparkle of an atom
between light and heat
we can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares
so go downtown
start the day off strong
with a kiss
and remember to bring your own lantern
it will be the sparkle of an atom
between light and heat
we can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares
so go downtown
start the day off strong
with a kiss
and remember to bring your own lantern
it will be the sparkle of an atom

it is day two
of a new year
and the paris calendar comes alive
will you take the bath or the tambourine?
furiation
is filled with frisson
some day i will return it
bloom, burst, and beamed
like the gods, they're just praying
to send rain or shine of glory
i'll be jolted awake
by the vibes you gave
you wereps multiply like mad
and they seek to take over
i'm not stopping
i'm going hunting
i'm the hunter

it's time to sort
there's no-one here
and people everywhere
crying 'cause i need you
crying i can feel you
crying 'cause i need you
crying 'cause i care
it's a hot day and i'm dressed lightly
i move carefully through the crowd
here everyone is so vulnerable
and i'm as well
there's no-one here
and people everywhere
crying 'cause i need you
crying i can feel you
crying 'cause i need you
crying 'cause i care
only if a ship would sail in
or just somebody came
and knocked on my door
or just, or just something
crying 'cause i need you
crying i can feel you
crying 'cause i need you
crying 'cause i care

she touched my arm and smiled
one of these days, soon, very soon
love you 'til then, love you 'til then
feel my breath on your neck
and your heart will race
don't say no to me
you can't say no to me
i won't see you
denied
i'm sorry you saw that
i'm sorry he did it
an echo, a stain
a stain
i can't say no to you

come on, girl
let's sneak out of this party
it's getting boring
there's more to life than this
it's still early morning
we could go down to the harbor
and jump between the boats
and see the sun come up
you know that there's more to life than this?
you know that there's more to life?
you know that there's more to life than this?

====================
i'll never forget your lips on mine
your love was needed
and now it is gone
i'll never return it
where is the line that says, "I love you"?
where is the line that says, "I love you too?"
where is the line that says, "I love you too?"
and you----------
you are the ones who make my dreams come true
a little song
electric shocks me
i am a light-bearer
like yourself, shining in the distance
but when i wake up
the first time
of a love that i never knew
i conquer claustrophobia
i wake up and the world feels the same
i shatter all my myths
i am the lantern that people think
they hide treasures in plain sight
i dash into hidden places
seek solace in the knowledge
that if i forget
anything i've done wrong
i shall go astray
like the killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a path of cinders
burning under your feet
you're the one that leads
where i'm rooted
you're the one that grows old
i wake up and the world feels the same

all these accidents that go along
with the start of a new day
you can't escape it all
you have to trust in you eyes
i can't get no love
and this is it:
love is the gate to hell
hell is a safe haven
for the confused
confused are the confused
loving one comfort
who wants to go down to the harbor
and see the sun?
who wants to go down to the harbor
and see the sun?
now everyone has a mouth to suck
everyone has a mouth to suck
and everyone has a mouth to suck
who wants to go down to the harbor
and see the sun?
who wants to go down to the harbor
and see the sun?
he wants to go down to the harbor
he wants to go down to the harbor
he wants to go down to the harbor
he wants to go down to the harbor

when i hear someone with same accent as yours
asking directions with the same beard as yours
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
isn't it odd?
isn't it peculiar?
these statistics of my mind
shuffling your features

the hardcore and the gentle

we just met
and i know i'm a bit too intimate
but something huge is coming up
and we're both included
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
i don't know my future after this weekend
and i don't want to

dear general macarthur
you're the one who says, "let's go hunting this snake"?
the other guy says, "let's go hunting this snake?"
and you have the courage to say, "yeah, right"
and the right guy to say, "yeah, right"
and the right guy to say, "yeah, right?"

i wish i want to stay here

i wish i only love you
i wish simplicity
look at the speed out there
it magnetizes me to it
and i have no fear
i'm only into this to
enjoy

i wish i'd only look
and didn't have to touch
i wish i'd only smell this
and didn't have to taste
how can i ignore?
this is sex without touching
i'm going to explore
i'm only into this to

i will wade out till my thighs
are steeped in burning flowers
i will take the sun in my mouth
and leap into the ripe air alive
with closed eyes
to dash against darkness
in the sleeping curves of my body
i shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
with chasteness of seagirls
will i complete the mystery of my flesh?
will i complete the mystery of my flesh, my flesh?

i walk through this land
stake a claim
with my sense
with my bark
mark my nest with song
hear the, the echo, echo from that cliff
i draw laser line through lake
to take physicality
i inhale this physicality
this forest is in me
this forest is in me
i immerse me
this is my home
this is, this is my home

if there is a troubador washing: it is he
if there is a man about town: it is he
if there is one to be sought: it is he
if there are nine she's: they are bought for me
this way is as is she
and he placed her unclothed, long, long, long-legged
on top of the family tree
and if he has chosen the point while she is under him
then leave her coily placed crouched sucking him
for it is i
with her on knee
i leave her without pith or feel
and leave her be
leave it be, for he controls what there'll be
he makes his face known to none
for if he is seen, then all will
and all will know
know me

excuse me
but i just have to
explode
explode this body
off me

with your wishful thinking
hopeful embraces
don't you understand?
i have to go through this
i belong to here where
no one cares, and no one loves
no light no air to live in
a place called hate
the city of fear
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
and the hurt stops
it's sometimes just like sleeping
curling up inside my private tortures
i nestle into pain
hug suffering
caress every ache
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead

as soft tissue feeds on blood
some day i'll find you, the urge is here

i knock on your skin, and i am in

the perfect match, you and me
i adapt, contagious
you open up, say welcome
like a flame that seeks explosives
as gunpowder needs a war
i feast inside you, my host

i'm alone
i'm taking an aeroplane

how come out of all the people in the world
only one can make me complete?
one word, one word on the phone
makes me happy
one touch, but one touch directly
makes me ecstatic
he's away

i'm alone
i'm taking an aeroplane
across the world

why can't you give her room?
respect her spatial needs
i feel you compress her
into a small space
with clairvoyance
she knew what you needed
and she gave it to you
now her desires are repressed
arrows in the flesh
when she, when she found your love
her nature bowed her head
she surrendered
she renounced the world for you
now she’s poisoned by demands
you cannot answer
why this sacrifice?
now she regrets the whole thing
a delayed reaction
when she left her craft voluntarily
for your nest, for your love
did you understand?
appreciate
build a bridge to her
initiate a touch
before it’s too late
say the words to her
that will make her shine
tell her that you love her
your generosity will show
in the volume of her glow
your generosity will show
in the volume of her glow
your generosity will show
in the volume of her glow

i remember you
you're the one that made my dreams come true
a few kisses ago
i remember you
you're the one that said, "i love you too
didn't you know?"
i remember too
a distant bell
and stars that fell
like rain, out of the blue
when my life is through
and the angels ask me to recall
the thrill of them all
i shall tell them: i remember you, you, you, you
i remember you
you're the one that made my dreams come true

bird species never seen or heard before
the first flute carved from the first fauna
utopia
it’s not elsewhere
let's purify
you assigned me to protect our lantern
to be intentional about the light
utopia
it isn't elsewhere
it’s here
my instinct has been shouting at me for years
saying, "let’s get out of here!"
huge toxic tumour bulging underneath the ground here
purify, purify, purify, purify toxicity

first snow of winter
i'm walking hills and valleys
adore this mystical fog!
this fucking mist!
these cliffs are just showing off!
then the body memory kicks in
i mime my home mountains
the moss that i'm made of
i redeem myself
i've been wrestling my fate
do i accept this ending?
will i accept my death
or struggle claustrophobic?
fought like a wolverine
with my destiny
refuse to accept what was meant to be
then the body memory kicks in
and i trust the unknown
unfathomable imagination
surrender to future
oh, how to capture all this love
and find a pathway for it
like threading an ocean through a needle
river through a keyhole
can't fathom the grasp
i can't grasp the fathom
then my body memory kicks in
my limbs and tongue take over
like the ancestors before me
show me the flow
my sexual dna
x-rays of my kama sutras
summons different bodies
compares spines and buttocks
and back of necks
then my body memory kicks in
it simply takes over
bestiality
i redeem my body
i wasn't born urban
toxic doesn't agree with me
love lured me here
into a stagnant state
my myths, my customs, ridiculed
vacuum packed molecules
then my body memory kicks in
on this brooklyn dance floor
sweating with these rhythms
rotate this matrix
all trapped in legal harness
kafkaesque
farce like patriarchy
avoided to confront it
then the body memory kicks in
my warrior awakens
my turn to defend
urban didn't tame me
then my body memory kicks in
all bosoms and embraces
oral, anal entrances
enjoy the satisfaction
if the other is growing

who would have known
that a boy like him
would have entered me lightly
restoring my blisses?
who would have known

after sharing my core
would stay going nowhere?
who would have known

who would have known
a saintly trance?
who would have known
miraculous breath?
to inhale a beard
loaded with courage
who would have known
that a boy like him
possessed of magical
sensitivity?
who would approach a girl like me
who caresses, cradles his head
in her bosom?
he slides inside
half awake, half asleep
we faint back
into sleephood
when i wake up
the second time
in his arms
gorgeousness
he's still inside me
who would have known?
who, who would have known?
a train of pearls
cabin by cabin
is shot precisely
across an ocean
from a mouth
from a

she always knows when people need stroking
and is attracted to deathbeds and divorces
i dreamt she cared for my dying grandfather
lying naked face down on his bed
she insists on total presence
and knows how to get through to the rest of us
she has entered me thousandfold often
and undone knots at my most awkward
music, music loves too
she reaches out to orphans and refugees
embraces them with thermal blankets
her favourite childhood moments
were at a hospital for the disabled
i've seen her offer empathy to widows
she attends funerals of strangers
her strongest memory
is feeding children with leprosy
music heals too
i'm here to defend it

when i spot someone who is same height as you
and goes to same record stores
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
when i hear someone with same accent as yours
asking directions with the same accent as yours
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
isn't it odd?
isn't it peculiar?
these statistics of my mind
shuffling your features
assembling a man
googling love
warming my heart on this log fire of love

i can sense it
something important
is about to happen
it's coming up
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
we just met
and i know i'm a bit too intimate

on the southern tip of the Andes
the boho dance floor
there dance royalty
there is a swarm of sound
around our heads
and we can hear it
around our heads
you shout and you yell, ah
and the angels around us
they surround us
and say:
"we have to flee from here
or return fire
with a clatter-board
it's been dinnertime
and dinnertime is up to you
dinnertime!
up to you
you, me, me, me
dinnertime

as the lukewarm
hands of the gods
came down and gently
picked my adrenalin pearls
they placed them in their mouths
and rinsed all the fear out
nourished them with their saliva
rested
as if the healthiest past time
is being in life-threatening circumstances
and once again be reborn
all birthed and happy
all birthed and happy
all birthed and happy
all birthed and happy
all birthed and happy
all birthed and happy
all birthed and happy
best way to start-a-new
is to fail miserably
fail at loving and fail at giving
fail at creating a flow
then realign the whole
and kick into the start hole
and kick into the start hole
and kick into the start hole
to risk all is the end-all and the beginning all
to risk all is the end-all and the beginning all

not 'til you halo all over me
i'll come over
not 'til it shimmers 'round your skull
i'll be yours
i weave for you
the marvellous web
glow in the dark threads
all neon like
the cocoon surrounds you
embraces all
so you can sleep
foetus-style
and they will assist us
'cause we're asking for help
and the luminous beam - it feeds you!
the soft distortion
fills you up
nourish, nourish
your turtleheart
and they will assist us
'cause we're asking for help
and the luminous beam - it feeds you!
don't get angry with yourself
don't, don't get angry with yourself
i'll heal you
with a razor blade
i'll cut a slit open
and the luminous beam
heals you honey, heals you
don't get angry with yourself
don't get angry with yourself
don't get angry with yourself
don't get angry with yourself
i'll heal you

i have walked this earth
and watched people
it doesn't scare me at all
i can be sincere
and say i like them
it doesn't
====================
cliffhanger like suspension
my longing has formed its own skeleton
bridging the gap between singletons
sending each others these songs
the interior of these melodies
is perhaps where we are meant to be
our physical union a fantasy
i just fell in love with a song
so, i reserve my own intimacies
i bundle them up in packages
my rawward longing far too visceral
did i just fall in love with love?

i'm a fountain of blood
in the shape of a girl
you're the bird on the brim
hypnotised by the whirl
drink me, make me feel real
wet your beak in the stream
game we're playing is life
love's a two way dream
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a path of cinders
burning under your feet
you're the one who walks me
i'm your one way street
i'm a whisper in the water
secret for you to hear
you're the one who grows distant
when i beckon you near
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a tree that grows hearts
one for each that you take
you're the intruder's hand
i'm the branch that you break

my healed chest wound
transformed into a gate
where i receive love from
where i give love from
and i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
split into many parts
splattered light beams into prisms
that will reunite
if you care for me, care for me
if you care for me, care for me
care for me, care for me
and then i'll care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
didn't used to be so needy
just more broken than normal
proud self-sufficiency
my silhouette is oval
it is a gate
i can care for you, care for you from
i can care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
you care for me, care for me
care for you

shh, shh
it's oh, so quiet, shh, shh
it's oh, so still, shh, shh
you're all alone, shh, shh
and so peaceful until
you fall in love, zing boom
the sky up above, zing boom
is caving in, wow bam!
you've never been so nuts about a guy
you wanna laugh, you wanna cry
you cross your heart and hope to die
till it's over, and then, shh, shh
it's nice and quiet, shh, shh
but soon again, shh, shh
starts another big riot
you blow a fuse, zing boom
the devil cuts loose, zing boom
so what's the use, wow bam!
of falling in love?
it's oh, so quiet
it's oh, so still
you're all alone
and so peaceful until
you ring the bell, bim bam
you shout and you yell, hi ho-ho
you broke the spell
gee, this is swell, you almost have a fit
this guy is "gorge" and i got hit
there's no mistake, this is it!
till it's over, and then
it's nice and quiet, shh, shh
but soon again, shh, shh
starts another big riot
you blow a fuse, zing boom
the devil cuts loose, zing boom
so what's the use, wow bam!
of falling in love?
the sky caves in
the devil cuts loose
you blow, blow, blow
blow, blow your fuse, ahh!
when you fall in love
shh

you'll be given love
you'll be taken care of
you'll be given love
you have to trust it
maybe not from the sources
you have poured yours
maybe not from the directions
you are staring at
twist your head around
it's all around you
all is full of love
all around you
====================
the ghost of a saint
hides in the hair
loves the eyes
purifies them
cleanse them
if things were done your way
i'm going hunting for mysteries
kafkaesque
fear of doom
lives on a cliff
hovering around it, its pitch-dark
watchful of danger
but never too angry
always happy when the sun comes up
the way it is made of steel
grey leaves are too much
for any mother to handle
a father must pull
his black hat down over the eyes

all that matters is that i get to meet you
the day has passed and the night has come
now i'm resting
my head is in the air about to go down
it's not up to you yet

as soft tissue feeds on blood
some day i'll find you, the urge is here

as the protein transmutates
i knock on your skin, and i am in

the perfect match, you and me
i adapt, contagious
you open up, say welcome
like a flame that seeks explosives
as gunpowder needs a war
i feast inside you, my host is you

lately
i find myself out gazing at stars
hearing guitars
like someone in love
sometimes the things i do astound me
mostly whenever you're around me
lately
i seem to walk as though i have wings
bump into things
like someone in love
each time i look at you, i'm limp as a glove
and feeling like someone in love
sometimes the things i do astound me
mostly whenever you're around me

you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
so go downtown
where all the lights are bright downtown
waiting for you tonight downtown
you're gonna be all right now
and you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
guide them along
so maybe i'll see you there
we can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares
so go downtown
things'll be great when you're downtown
don't wait a minute for downtown
everything's waiting for you

come on girl
let's sneak out of this party!
it's getting boring
there's more to life than this
it's still early morning
we could go down to the harbor
and jump between the boats
and see the sun come up
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life

we could nick a boat
and sneak off to this island
i could bring my little ghetto blaster
there's more to life than this
but we'd have to rush back
to the town's best baker
to get the first bread of the morning
there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life than this

eitt sinn tók ég tali gamlan tötralegan mann
ég var á vappi niðri við höfn - á bryggjunni stóð hann
hann sagði mér frá landi einu, langt af leið það er
on nú er eins og eitthvað hafi brostið inní mér
alta mira - ævintýralanið er
alta mira - þangað hugurinn mig ber
alta mira - ævintýralanið er
alta mira - þangað hugurinn mig ber
sá gamli sagði mer þar sólin sægræn væri á lit
i sjónum spekingslegar syntu kýrnar út á hlið
hann seli sá í söngleik í silfurtitum skóm
um torgin töltu tífælur í kjólfötum með blóm
alta mira - ævintýralanið er
alta mira - þangað hugurinn mig ber
alta mira - ævintýralanið er
alta mira - þangað hugurinn mig ber
hæ - alta mira - lalalalala-lala







drengurrin litli hann krýpur á knéð
krossleggur hendurnar svo guð fái séð
uss - hljótt - hvað?
drengurrin litli sem bænir fer með
góði guð farðu ei mömmu frá
hún háttar mig og baðar og er mér hjá
svo klærðir hún mig í náttföt hlý
guð blessið pabba ég gleymdi því
þegar hugsa ég um hvað sem gerðist í dag
kemur upp í huga mér lítið lag
ég má ei hætta bænina við
fyrigefðu guð, ég vel þig bið
náttfötin mín eru hettu með
í hettuni hö

i'm erect, ooh
but there's no need, i'm going to bed
i wake you up
not now, but tomorrow
and see how many stars there are
and they're going around
oh, how they glow
they fill the sky with stars
ignore them, they're all around you
you're the earth from cradle to grave
now is the time to shine a light
ignore them, ignore them
oh, how they're everywhere
now is the time to shine a light
ignore them, ignore them

if living is seeing
and living is smelling
i can sense all that exists
is that, a touch
a touch of kindness
to be tolerant of others
who are tolerant of you
but if another were me
there would be no fear
i would be tolerant
of those who are me
and if that were me
i would be tolerant
of those who are me
there is a saying that says
if you ever get close to a human
and human behaviour
be ready, be ready to get confused
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
to human behaviour
but yet so, yet so irresistible
and there is no map
they're terribly, terribly, terribly moody
oh, human behaviour
then all of a sudden turn happy
but, oh, to get involved in the exchange
of human emotions
is ever so, ever so satisfying
and there is no map
human behaviour, human, human

human behaviour, human, human

i've seen people that are just like me
and yet so different
from everyone i know
just by their nature
there is no more to see
not here to live by
and if i grow fond of it
i shall turn my face
and find someone to take me
another thousand springs
i'm googling 'em' and come up with the words i've needed

the joys and fears of fathers
they gave me a pacifier
a soft drink
to help calm me down
the fears that fathers
seemed to induce
i don't know what to do with them
or where to put them
or where to stay my love

and the day feels a-broken
just lean into the crack
just lean into the crack

unthinkable surprises

she always knows when people need stroking
and is attracted to deathbeds and divorces
i dreamt she cared for my dying grandfather
lying naked face down on his bed
she insists on total presence
and knows how to get through to the rest of us
she has entered me thousandfold often
and undone knots at my most awkward
music, music loves too
she reaches out to orphans and refugees
embraces them with thermal blankets
her favourite childhood moments
were at a hospital for the disabled
i've seen her offer empathy to widows
she attends funerals of strangers
her strongest memory
is feeding children with leprosy
music heals too
i'm here to defend it

i have a recurrent dream
every time i lose my voice
i swallow little glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me
during the nights
they do a trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above my bed
while i'm asleep
my mother and son pour into me
warm glowing oil
into my wide open throat
i have a recurrent dream
every time i feel a hoarseness
i swallow warm glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me, oh
they make me feel so much better
they make me feel better
we have a recurrent dream
every time we lose our voices
we dream we swallow little lights
our mother and son bakes for us
during the nights
they do a little trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above our heads
while we're asleep
my mother and son pour into us
pour into us
warm glowing oil
into our wide open throats
i have a recurrent dream
they make me feel better
they make me feel better

i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is where i'm staying
this is my home
i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it

one day
it will happen
one day it will all come true
one day, one day
when you're ready
one day, one day
when you're up to it
the atmosphere
will get lighter
and two suns ready
to shine just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day
it will happen
one day it will all make sense
one day, one day
when you're ready
an aeroplane
will curve gracefully
around the volcano
with the eruption that never lets you down
i can feel it
i can feel it
and the beautifullest
fireworks are burning
in the sky, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh
just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day

genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
so warm
sounds go through the muscles
these abstract, wordless movements
move, move, move, move, move
they start off cells that haven't been touched before
these cells are virgins
waking up slowly waking up
waking up slowly wake up
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
nothing will be the same
i'm asleep
i'm fast asleep
i like this resonance
it elevates me
i don't recognise myself
this is very interesting
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
i'm fast asleep now
you're still with me
i'm fast asleep
i'm asleep
my headphones
they saved, saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

i shuffle around the tectonic plates in my chest
you know i gave it all
try to match our continents
to change seasonal shift
to form a mutual core
as fast as your fingernail grows
the atlantic ridge drifts
to counteract distance
you know i gave it all
can you hear the effort
of the magnetic strife?
shuffling of columns
to form a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
you hid the key to our continuity
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know
what you resist persists
nuance makes heat
to counteract distance
i know you gave it all
offered me harmony
if things were done your way
my eurasian plate subsumed
forming a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know i had it in me
this eruption undoes stagnation
you
====================
i have fostered for years, and will always have fostered for you?
childrens' plays, they always are
i remember your silky smooth skin, its smooth and smooth
soft hands, slippery with oils
i'm gently driating your face
soft on the ground, mylene
she's found your scent, her
her warm and welcoming
she's found your secret
her slippery tongue is exploring
we're kissing, we're kissing
i remember your eyes, their sparkling fire
as if in trance
i remember your eyelids, their intricate
threadbare eyelids
lulled the world over
until we're inside her clutches
and she finds your secret
she finds your secret, she finds yours
weighing the evidence
she finds your truth, she finds yours
the victor
the coward
the truth is absolute
the truth is absolute
she finds your truth, she finds yours
she finds your truth, she finds yours

the truth is absolute

i can not live
peacefully without you
for even a moment
i miss you terribly
when you're away
he's away
this ain't right
i'm alone
i'm taking an aeroplane
across the world
to follow my heart
i'm not angry
i'm sorry
i got into a scuffle
with a star
and is out of gas
this fiery mess can get confusing
i know all the places i'd like to go
away from home
i know all the places i'd like to go
away from home
i miss you terribly
but i haven't met you yet
so special
but it hasn't happened yet
you are gorgeous
but i haven't met you yet
i remember
but it hasn't happened yet
and if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i will meet you
i was peaking
but it hasn't happened yet
i haven't been given
my best souvenir
i miss you terribly
but i haven't met you yet
i know your habits
but wouldn't recognise you yet
and if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i wish
i miss you terribly
i'm so impatient
i can't stand the wait
when will i get my cuddle?
who are you?
i know by now that you'll arrive
by the time i stop waiting
i miss you

all the modern things
like cars and such
have always existed
they've just been waiting in a mountain
for the right moment
listening to the irritating noises
of dinosaurs and people
dabbling outside

when i hear someone with same accent as yours
asking directions with the same beard as yours
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
isn't it odd?
isn't it peculiar?
these statistics of my mind
shuffling your features
assembling a man
googling love
warming my heart on this log fire of love
features creatures

i can sense it
something important
is about to happen
it's coming up
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
we just met
and i know i'm a bit too intimate
but something huge is coming up
and we're both included
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
i don't know my future after this weekend
and i don't want to
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality, sensuality

he turned me down, i then downturned another
who then downturned her
the paralyzing juice of rejection
his veins full of lead
he's left with loving what he lost
more than what he has
my snakeskin cold in the dark
but warms up in the light
i then upturned a green eyed giant
who upturned and entered me
will we stop seeing what unites us
but only what differs?
the ghosts of old loves
hovering around his orifices, his orifices...
as you narrate your own hearttale
you thread souls into one beam
the love you gave and have been given
weave into your own dream
i trust my cells to rearchive
my love historic stream

same old cloud, claustrophobic me
let it burst like old train sounds
make them leave me nature

my arms ooze out of my shoulders!
and the arms ooze out of my shoulders

please release this pressure of me
let off some steam

heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me, make me wonder
they say back then our universe was an empty sea
until a silver fox and her cunning mate
began to sing a song that became the world we know
heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me, make me wonder
and they say back then our universe was a cold black egg
until the god inside burst out and from its shattered shell
he made what became the world we know
heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me, make me wonder
and they say back then our universe was an endless land
until our ancestors woke up and before they went back to sleep
they carved it all into the world we know
heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me, make me wonder
and they say back then our universe wasn’t even there
until a sudden bang and then there was light, was sound, was matter
and it all became the world we know
heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me and dance eternal

i am strong in his hands, i am beyond me
on my own, i am human, and i do faults
i do confess, i feel you trickling
down my shoulders from above
i turn myself in, i give myself up
volunteer, you own me i'm yours
you have to trust it, i'm eternally yours
all that i gave them, i gave to you
so needy of comfort, but too raw to be embraced
undo this privacy and put me in my place
generous palmstroke: the hugest of hugs
undo this privacy, embrace
embrace me
embrace me
embrace me

i am strong in his hands, i am above
way beyond me, i can't...

the pleasure is all mine
to get to be the generous one
is the strongest stance
the pleasure is all mine
to finally let go
and evenly flow
who gives most
who gives most
who gives most
the pleasure is all mine
women like us
we strengthen most
host-like
when in doubt: give
when in doubt: give
when in doubt: give

i love your eyes, my dear
their splendid sparkling fire
when suddenly you raise them so
to cast a swift embracing glance
like lightning flashing in the sky
but there's a charm that is greater still:
when my love's eyes are lowered
when all is fired by passions kiss
and through the downcast lashes
i see the dull flame of desire
and through the downcast lashes

get over the sorrow, girl
the world is always going to be made of this
you can trust in it
unless you breathe in
bravely
i adore how you simply surrender to high
and your lungs, they're mourning
t-b style
all the stillborn love that could've happened
all the moments you should have embraced
all the moments you should have not locked up
understand so clearly:
to shut yourself up
would be the hugest crime of them all
hugest crime of them all
you're just crying after all
to not want them humans around
anymore
get over that sorrow, girl
get over it

hollow
my ancestors have access
hollow
i'm falling down the abyss
hollow
looking for some answers
generations of mothers sailing in
somehow they all were shipfolks
hollow
the ground is opening up
swallows me up
the trunk of dna
the trunk of dna, trunk
now come forth, all species
hollow
like a bead in necklace
thread me upon this chain
i'm part of it, ohh
the everlasting necklace
jewels after jewels after jewels after
jewels after jewels after jewels
i yearn to belong
let me belong
let me belong

up on the toe
there is a view
up on the toe
and the spine
straight and erect
hungry and curious
up on the toe
looking forward to
the air is thinner here
she came here
to lose face
got down on her knees
the beast is back!
on four legs
set her clock to the moon
raises her spine
vertebrae by vertebrae
up on the toe
looking
i have been filled with steam for months, for years
same old cloud, claustrophobic me
let it burst like old train sounds
make them leave me nature
vertebrae by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
my arms ooze out of my shoulders!
and the arms ooze out of my shoulders
i curl my tail inwards, inwards
i set my clock on the moon
vertebrae by vertebrae

now, to our modern day
shower of goodness, divine

eitt sinn tók ég tali gamlan tötralegan mann
ég var á vappi niðri við höfn - á bryggjunni stóð hann
hann sagði mér frá landi einu, langt af leið það er
on nú er eins og eitthvað hafi brostið inní mér
alta mira - ævintýralanið er
alta mira - þangað hugurinn mig ber
alta mira - ævintýralanið er
alta mira - þangað hugurinn mig ber
sá gamli sagði mer þar sólin sægræn væri á lit
i sjónum spekingslegar syntu kýrnar út á hlið
hann seli sá í söngleik í silfurtitum skóm
um torgin töltu tífælur í kjólfötum með blóm
alta mira - ævintýralanið er
alta mira - þangað hugurinn mig ber
alta mira - ævintýralanið er
alta mira - þangað hugurinn mig ber
hæ - alta mira - lalalalala-lala







drengurrin litli hann krýpur á knéð
krossleggur hendurnar svo guð fái séð
uss - hljótt - hvað?
drengurrin litli sem bænir fer með
góði guð farðu ei mömmu frá
hún háttar mig og baðar og er mér hjá
svo klærðir hún mig í náttföt hlý
guð blessið pabba ég gleymdi því
þegar hugsa ég um hvað sem gerðist í dag
kemur upp í huga mér lítið lag
ég má ei hætta bænina við
fyrigefðu guð, ég vel þig bið
náttfötin mín eru hettu með
í hettuni höfuðið vel ég fel
hún augu mín hylur og ennið með
enginn veit að ég þar er
þákka þér guð fyrir góðan dag
gleymdi ég einhverju, hvað var það?
ég bad fyrir pabba og hugsaði um þig
já nú man ég - guð blessi mig
drengurrin litli han sefur nú rótt
dagurrin liðinn, komin er nótt
uss - hljótt - hvað?
drengurrin litli sem bænirnar bað

a ship sinks in the harbor
with a bang
the sun sets
and the sailors in the harbor
its not the people in the harbor
it's the people in the harbor
who go out in a riot
stirring at water's edge
draining the juice
i'm not hurting anyone
i'm just showing them a story
our species, our species
itheres at war
some day we'll come up to the city
and cut loose at will
some day we'll come up to the sky
and soar above
while i'm gone
i'm trying my best to make amends
some day i'm stuck at the border
underwater
where the dead come ashore
still trying to come up
to the obvious
how do i make amends?
split into many parts
how do i make amends?
how do i make amends?
live by your side
i take pity on my son
you're the one to blame
i'm sorry i let you down
i'm sorry you saw that
you were attracted to corpses
how do i put an end to this?
how do i end this pain?
by darlin night
dear night
you're the one to blame
i'll heal you
but you'll be dinnertime
i don't know when you'll be able to say hello
i don't know when you'll be able to say hello
you're the one who said hello
i'll heal you
i don't know when you'll be able to say hello
oh i have a feeling you'll arrive
by daybreak
the priestess poses as if to say
fear is a powerful drug
overcome it and with
hand me over the key
open the key and i key you up
cash out of accounts everywhere
cash out of accounts everywhere
cash out of accounts everywhere
oh i have a feeling you'll arrive
by nightfall
to your surprise
the priestess poses as if to say
i'm your host, host of you
i'm your host, host of you

oh i have a feeling you'll arrive
by daybreak
to your surprise
the priestess poses as if to say

while i crawl into the unknown
cover me
i'm going hunting for mysteries
cover me
i'm going to prove the impossible exists
this is really dangerous
cover me
but worth all the effort
cover me
i'm going to prove the impossible really exists

there is yet another one
that follows me
wherever i go
and supports me
all this tooth is warmth-like
this tooth is warmth-like
this tooth is warmth-like
and these teeth are a ladder up to his mouth
all these teeth are a ladder that i walk
that you can walk too if you want
if you want up to the mouth
the mouth's cradle
up to the mouth's cradle
he always has a hope for me
always sees me when nothing else
and everyone have left
that ghost is brighter than anyone
and fulfills me with hope
those beams assure me
and you can use these teeth as a ladder
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
and you can follow these notes i'm singing
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
the simplicity of the ghost-like beast
the purity of what it wants and where it goes
always love, always loves you, always loves you
infrared love
and you can use those teeth as a ladder
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
and you can use those teeth, oh, follow my voice
tooth by tooth
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
i need a shelter to build an altar away
from all osamas and bushes
i need a shelter to build an altar away
from all osamas and bushes

i once had no fears
none at all
and then when
i had some
to my surprise
i grew to like both
scared or brave
without them
the thrill of fear
thought i'd never admit it
the thrill of fear
now greatly

she always knows when people need stroking
and is attracted to deathbeds and divorces
i dreamt she cared for my dying grandfather
lying naked face down on his bed
she insists on total presence
and knows how to get through to the rest of us
she has entered me thousandfold often
and undone knots at my most awkward
music, music loves too
she reaches out to orphans and refugees
embraces them with thermal blankets
her favourite childhood moments
were at a hospital for the disabled
i've seen her offer empathy to widows
she attends funerals of strangers
her strongest memory
is feeding children with leprosy
music heals too
i'm here to defend it

what's the lesser of two evils
if a suicide bomber made to look pregnant
manages to kill her target or not?
what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if she kills them or dies in vain?

love is all
i dare to drown

and, like that, it travels along an elliptical path
drawn into the darkness
an unpolished pearl
in sky-black palm of hand
flickering sun-flame
and then you remember
that you, yourself, you are a light-bearer, a light-bearer
receiving radiance from others
flickering sun-flame
unpolished earth

show me forgiveness
for having lost faith in myself
and let my own interior up
to inferior forces
the shame is endless
but if soon start forgiveness
the girl might live

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
i see who you are
i see who you.... are...

it may not always be so
and i say that if your lips
which i have loved
should touch another's
and your dear strong fingers clutch her heart
as mine in time not far away
if on another's face your sweet hair lay
in such a silence as i know
or such great writhing words as, uttering overmuch
stand helplessly before the spirit at bay
if this should be, i say if this should be
you of my heart, send me a little word
that i may go unto her, and take her hands saying
accept all happiness from me
then i shall turn my face
and hear one bird sing terribly afar in the lost lands

when will it be time to document?
do it now!
this submarine behaviour
do it now!
when time?

you've got to manage
i won't sympathize
anymore

you'll meet an army of me

you'll meet an army of me, army of me

i wish i want to stay here
i wish this be enough
i wish i only love you
i wish simplicity
look at the speed out there
it magnetizes me to it
and i have no fear
i'm only into this to
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
i wish i'd only look
and didn't have to touch
i wish i'd only smell this
and didn't have to taste
how can i ignore?
this is sex without touching
i'm going to explore
i'm only into this to
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy

i will wade out till my thighs
are steeped in burning flowers
i will take the sun in my mouth
and leap into the ripe air alive
with closed eyes
to dash against darkness
in the sleeping curves of my body
i shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
with chasteness of seagirls
will i complete the mystery of my flesh?
will i complete the mystery of my flesh, my flesh?

i walk through this land
stake a claim
with my sense
of justice
with my sense
of justice

i'm using lipstick again
i suck my tongue
in remembranceofyou
possibly maybe
probably love
possiblymaybe
probably love
mon petit vulcan
your eruptions anddisasters
i keep calm
admiring your lava
i keep calm
possibly maybe
probably love
possibly maybe
probably love
electric shocks
i love them!
with you, dozen a day
but after a while i wonder
where's that love you promised me? where is it?
possibly maybe
probably love
possibly, possibly
probably love
how can you o-?
where's that love you...?
where's that love you promised me? where is it?
possibly maybe
how can you offer me love like that?
how can you offer me love like that?
my heart's burned
how can you offer me love like that?
i'm exhausted, leave me alone
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe

come to me
i'll take care of you
protect you
calm, calm down
you're exhausted
come lie down
you don't havetoexplain
i understand
you knowthat i love you
you know, youknow
jump off
your building's on fire
i'll catch you
destroy all that is keeping you down

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
and enjoy every bit of you
of you
i see who you are
i see who you... are...

we live on a mountain
right at the top
there's a beautiful view
from the top of themountain
everymorning i walktowards the edge
and throw little thingsoff
like car parts, bottles and cutlery
or whatever i find lying around
it's become a habit
a way to start the day
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
it's real early morning
no one is awake
i'm back at my cliff
still throwing things off
i listen to sounds they make
on their way down

====================
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day
one day, one day

i won't let you say thank you anymore
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
she took it from the tree

i have a recurrent dream
every time i lose my voice
i swallow little glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me
during the nights
they do a trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above my bed
while i'm asleep
my mother and son pour into me
warm glowing oil
into my wide open throat
i have a recurrent dream
every time i feel a hoarseness
i swallow warm glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me, oh
they make me feel so much better
they make me feel better
we have a recurrent dream
every time we lose our voices
we dream we swallow little lights
our mother and son bakes for us
during the nights
they do a little trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above our heads
while we're asleep
my mother and son pour into us
pour into us
warm glowing oil
into our wide open throats
i have a recurrent dream
they make me feel better
they make me feel better

i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is where i'm staying
this is my home
i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is where i'm staying
this is my home

one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it will all come true
one day
when you're ready
one day, one day
when you're up to it
the atmosphere
will get lighter
and two suns ready
to shine just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it will all make sense
one day
you will blossom
one day, one day
when you're ready
an aeroplane
will curve gracefully
around the volcano
with the eruption that never lets you down
i can feel it
i can feel it
and the beautifullest
fireworks are burning
in the sky, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh
just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
it will all come true
one day
one day, one day

genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
so warm
sounds go through the muscles
these abstract, wordless movements
move, move, move, move, move
they start off cells that haven't been touched before
these cells are virgins
waking up slowly waking up
waking up slowly wake up
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
nothing will be the same
i'm asleep
i'm fast asleep
i like this resonance
it elevates me
i don't recognise myself
this is very interesting
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
i'm fast asleep now
you're still with me
i'm fast asleep
i'm asleep
my headphones
they saved, saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

i shuffle around the tectonic plates in my chest
you know i gave it all
try to match our continents
to change seasonal shift
to form a mutual core
as fast as your fingernail grows
the atlantic ridge drifts
to counteract distance
you know i gave it all
can you hear the effort
of the magnetic strife?
shuffling of columns
to form a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
you hid the key to our continuity
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know
what you resist persists

====================
i'm a fountain of blood
in the shape of a girl
you're the bird on the brim
hypnotised by the whirl
drink me, make me feel real
wet your beak in the stream
game we're playing is life
love's a two way dream
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a path of cinders
burning under your feet
you're the one who walks me
i'm your one way street
i'm a whisper in the water
secret for you to hear
you're the one who grows distant
when i beckon you near
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a tree that grows hearts
one for each that you take
you're the intruder's hand
i'm the branch that you break

my healed chest wound
transformed into a gate
where i receive love from
where i give love from
and i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
split into many parts
splattered light beams into prisms
that will reunite
if you care for me, care for me
if you care for me, care for me
care for me, care for me
and then i'll care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
didn't used to be so needy
just more broken than normal
proud self-sufficiency
my silhouette is oval
it is a gate
i can care for you, care for you from
i can care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
you care for me, care for me
care for you

shh, shh
it's oh, so quiet, shh, shh
it's oh, so still, shh, shh
you're all alone, shh, shh
and so peaceful until
you fall in love, zing boom
the sky up above, zing boom
is caving in, wow bam!
you've never been so nuts about a guy
you wanna laugh, you wanna cry
you cross your heart and hope to die
till it's over, and then, shh, shh
it's nice and quiet, shh, shh
but soon again, shh, shh
starts another big riot
you blow a fuse, zing boom
the devil cuts loose, zing boom
so what's the use, wow bam!
of falling in love?
it's oh, so quiet
it's oh, so still
you're all alone
and so peaceful until
you ring the bell, bim bam
you shout and you yell, hi ho-ho
you broke the spell
gee, this is swell, you almost have a fit
this guy is "gorge" and i got hit
there's no mistake, this is it!
till it's over, and then
it's nice and quiet, shh, shh
but soon again, shh, shh
starts another big riot
you blow a fuse, zing boom
the devil cuts loose, zing boom
so what's the use, wow bam!
of falling in love?
the sky caves in
the devil cuts loose
you blow, blow, blow
blow, blow your fuse, ahh!
when you fall in love
shh

you'll be given love
you'll be taken care of
you'll be given love
you have to trust it
maybe not from the sources
you have poured yours
maybe not from the directions
you are staring at
twist your head around
it's all around you
all is full of love
all around you
all is full of love
you just ain't receiving
all is full of love
your phone is off the hook
all is full of love
your doors are all shut

all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love

o cold
the nights are cold
the streets are empty
the bravo rich with promise
the little boy who says he wants to go to heaven
the sky is clear as a bellow
and the angels say they want them
they are ringing the bell
all that is quiet is all that is needed
all that is needed is a shout
to follow suit
my heart'schurning
i'm trying my best
to not fall into the sea
and then drown
i'm not suggesting a place
a place like that be abandoned
i' daresay
i'm suggesting a thing
that might happen
and be a place
that's not too far away
like the night is falling
i'm trying my best
to not fall into the sea
and then drown
i'm not suggesting a place
a place like that be abandoned
i'm suggesting a thing
that might happen
and be a place
that's not too far away

sweat off the human race
speciesism

thoughtlessly swimming
head to toe in the current
ohhh!!
it's so quiet out there
it's oceanic
we're the birds on the island
ohh-so-quiet
it's quiet now
you're all alone
i'm trying to get some sleep

our love was only meant to last
a few moments ago
but when you wake up, you know that you have the power
to change the whole
all that was done for me was right
now is spent
it is time to heal
before you go away

she always knows when people need stroking
and is attracted to deathbeds and divorces
i dreamt she cared for my dying grandfather
lying naked face down on his bed
she insists on total presence
and knows how to get through to the rest of us
she has entered me thousandfold often
and undone knots at my most awkward
music, music loves too
she reaches out to orphans and refugees
embraces them with thermal blankets
her favourite childhood moments
were at a hospital for the disabled
i've seen her offer empathy to widows
she attends funerals of strangers
her strongest memory
is feeding children with leprosy
music heals too
i'm here to defend it

when i spot someone who is same height as you
and goes to same record stores
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
when i hear someone with same accent as yours
asking directions with the same beard as yours
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
isn't it odd?
isn't it peculiar?

bærinn minn
bærinn minn og þinn
sefur sæll í kyrrð
fellur mjöll
hljótt í húmi á jörð
grasið mitt
grasið mitt og þitt
geymir mold til vors
hjúfrar lind
leynt við brekkurót

lífi trútt
kyrrlátt kalda vermsl

grimmum töfrum tryllt
eirðarlaus
ottast nótt og dag
augu þín
ottalaus og hrein
brosa við mér björt

i have a recurrent dream
every time i lose my voice
i swallow little glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me
during the nights
they do a trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above my bed
while i'm asleep
my mother and son pour into me
warm glowing oil
into my wide open throat
i have a recurrent dream
every time i feel a hoarseness
i swallow warm glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me, oh
they make me feel so much better
they make me feel better
we have a recurrent dream
every time we lose our voices
we dream we swallow little lights
our mother and son bakes for us
during the nights
they do a little trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above our heads
while we're asleep
my mother and son pour into us
pour into us
warm glowing oil
into our wide open throats
i have a recurrent dream
they make me feel better
they make me feel better

i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is where i'm staying
this is my home
i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is where i'm staying
this is my home

one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it will all come true
one day
when you're ready
one day, one day
when you're up to it
the atmosphere
will get lighter
and two suns ready
to shine just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it will all make sense
one day
you will blossom
one day, one day
when you're ready
an aeroplane
will curve gracefully
around the volcano
with the eruption that never lets you down
i can feel it
i can feel it
and the beautifullest
fireworks are burning
in the sky, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh
====================
how can you offer love like that?
my heart's burned
how can you offer love like that?
how can you offer love like that?
i'm exhausted, leave me alone
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
since we broke up
i'm using lipstick again
i suck my tongue
in remembrance of you
possibly maybe

through the warmthest cord of care
your love was sent to me
i'm not sure what to do with it
or where to put it
i'm so close to tears
and so close to
simply calling you up
and simply suggesting
we go to that hidden place
that we go to that hidden place
we go to that hidden place
we go to the hidden place
now i have been slightly shy
and i can smell a pinch of hope
to almost have allowed one's fingers
to stroke the fingers i was given to touch with
but careful, careful
there lies my passion, hidden
there lies my love
i'll hide it under a blanket
lull it to sleep
i'll keep it in a hidden place
i'll keep it in a hidden place
keep it in a hidden place
keep it in a hidden place
keep it in a hidden place
he's the beautifullest, fragilest
still strong, dark and divine
and the littleness of his movements
hides himself
he invents a charm that makes him invisible
hides in the hair
can i hide there too?
hide in the hair of him
seek solace
sanctuary
in that hidden place
in a hidden place
in a hidden place
we'll stay in a hidden place
oh, in a hidden place
we'll live in a hidden place
we'll be in a hidden place
in a hidden place

we are all swollen
from hiding his affairs
let's put it all on the table
let it all out
it is time
he mustn't steal our light
clean plate: tabula rasa for my children
clean plate: not repeating the fuck-ups of the fathers
my deepest wish
is that you’re immersed in grace and dignity
but you will have to deal with shit soon enough
i hoped to give you the least amount of luggage
got the right to make your own fresh mistakes
and not repeat others' failures
clean plate: tabula rasa for my children
let's clean up: break the chain of the fuck-ups of the fathers
it is time: for us women to rise and not just take it lying down
it is time: the world is listening
oh, how i love you
embarrassed to pass this mess over to you
but he led two lives
thought ours was the only one
you are strong
you are strong
you are strong
you're so strong

imagine a future and be in it
feel this incredible nurture, soak it in
your past is on loop—turn it off
see this possible future and be in it
hold fort for love forever
we're just momentary vessels
we're just carrying
trust your head around
guide your stare elsewhere
your love is already waiting
you're already in it
hold fort for love forever
watch me form new nests
weave a matriarchal dome
build a musical scaffolding
between sleep and awake
day and night
between night and day
you say i mirror peoples' missions at them
now you mirror at me who i used to be
what i gave to the world
you've giving back at me
hold fort for love forever

define her abyss
show it respect
then a celestial nest
will grow above
when i'm broken, i am whole
and when i'm whole, i'm broken
our mother's philosophy
it feels like quicksand
and if she sinks
i'm going down with her
locate her black lake
the steam from this pit
will form a cloud
for her to live on
when she's broken, she is whole
and when she's whole, she's broken
our mother's philosophy
it feels like quicksand
and if she sinks
i'm going down with her
hackle this darkness
up to the light
where choreographed oxygen
embroiders the air
when we're broken we are whole
and when we're whole we're broken
we are the siblings of the sun
let's step into this beam
every time you give up
you take away our future
and my continuity and my daughter's
and her daughters
and her daughters
and her daughters

my tear duct clogged
my left eye
====================
see also: sees, ears, sense organs
like cells in many heads
each carrying a key
when suddenly the core of one
fell into disarray
one by one it fell into disarray
consolidating into a body
accurately assembled
tailors a universal vision
we aim at ever-evolving your
tailor
we recognise all DNA
and each gene that is different
and if one copy falls
how come there, there being many
and the same accent?
we ask ourselves
and the tools we have
are often divided
confused, to be clear
how can one soul
if one song
if one verse
if one aeron
if one goo
is placed
where all cells are one
and all parts are one
how do one soul
if one song
if one verse
if one aeron
if one goo

where all cells are one
and all parts are one
one by one soul

one by one soul

if you're having a ball
this is a musical!
there is no score to be found
the violins are loud
and the keys are quiet
there is no score to be found
music is all around us
and the birds are singing
happy, happy day
here is the score:

crying 'cause i need you

it's a hot day and i'm dressed lightly
i move carefully through the crowd
here everyone is so vulnerable

there's no-one here yet

come to my place
this is where i want to be
free will, love, take over
it will be simple, it will be overnight
it is still early morning
no one is awake
i'm alone and
there is always someone to be had
there is always someone to be had
there is always someone to be had
i do, do
i do, do
yes, i do
yes, i do
what's so easy?
to be able to offer up
to be able to offer up

how do i be able to offer up

define a style
that is simple
and stays in a simple place
and doesn't get in the way
it's time to break up
craving?
is broken up
can i be sincere?
or is it, is there something wrong?
simple
and the world around her
proudly turns upside down
our mother's philosophy
it takes courage to be sincere
and the world around her
proud of you?
to be honest, i really don't care
i've seen it all, i've seen the trees
i've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
i've seen a man killed by his best friend
and lives that were over before they were spent
i've seen what i was — i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru!
i'm happy to say i had better to do
what about china? have you seen the great wall?
all walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!
and the man you will marry?
the home you will share?
to be honest, i really don't care
i've seen it all, i've seen the dark
i've seen the brightness in one little spark
i've seen what i chose and i've seen what i need
and that is enough, to want more would be greed
i've seen what i was and i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you've seen it all and all you have seen
you can always review on your own little screen
the light and the dark, the big and the small
just keep in mind — you need no more at all
you've seen what you were and know what you'll be
you've seen it all — there is no more to see!

i miss you
but i haven't met you yet
so special
but it hasn't happened yet
you are gorgeous
but i haven't met you yet
i remember
but it hasn't happened yet
and if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i will meet you
i was peaking
but it hasn't happened yet
i haven't been given
my best souvenir
i miss you
but i haven't met you yet
i know your habits
but wouldn't recognise you yet
and if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i miss you
i'm so impatient
i can't stand the wait
when will i get my cuddle?
who are you?
i know by now that you'll arrive
by the time i stop waiting
i miss you

all the modern things
like cars and such
have always existed
they've just been waiting in a mountain
for the right moment
listening to the irritating noises
of dinosaurs and people
dabbling outside
engin fylgist alveg
sólin sekkur
engin sér við mér
það er sól þegar
andar inn í mér
====================
show me emotional respect
before you go away
let me offer you emotional respect

i know you were exhausted
maybe you should take a walk
this is warm up
this is not cynicism
this is not sentimental
this is not cynicism
this is not cynicism
i know you're tired
maybe you should take a walk

i know you're tired

while you are away
my heart comes undone
slowly unravels
in a ball of yarn
the devil collects it
with a grin
our love
in a ball of yarn
he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love
he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love
while you are away
my heart comes undone
slowly unravels
in a ball of yarn
the devil collects it
with a grin
our love, our love

he'll never return it

we'll have to make new love
he'll never return it

bird species never seen or heard before
the first flute carved from the first fauna
utopia
it’s not elsewhere
let's purify
you assigned me to protect our lantern
to be intentional about the light
utopia
it isn't elsewhere
it’s here
my instinct has been shouting at me for years
saying, "let’s get out of here!"
huge toxic tumour bulging underneath the ground here
purify, purify, purify, purify toxicity

first snow of winter
i'm walking hills and valleys
adore this mystical fog!
this fucking mist!
these cliffs are just showing off!
then the body memory kicks in
i mime my home mountains
the moss that i'm made of
i redeem myself
i've been wrestling my fate
do i accept this ending?
will i accept my death
or struggle claustrophobic?
fought like a wolverine
with my destiny
refuse to accept what was meant to be
then the body memory kicks in
and i trust the unknown
unfathomable imagination
surrender to future
oh, how to capture all this love
and find a pathway for it
like threading an ocean through a needle
river through a keyhole
can't fathom the grasp
i can't grasp the fathom
then my body memory kicks in
my limbs and tongue take over
like the ancestors before me
show me the flow
my sexual dna
x-rays of my kama sutras
summons different bodies
compares spines and buttocks
and back of necks
then my body memory kicks in
it simply takes over
bestiality
i redeem my body
i wasn't born urban
toxic doesn't agree with me
love lured me here
into a stagnant state
my myths, my customs, ridiculed
vacuum packed molecules
then my body memory kicks in
on this brooklyn dance floor
sweating with these rhythms
rotate this matrix
all trapped in legal harness
kafkaesque
farce like patriarchy
avoided to confront it
then the body memory kicks in
my warrior awakens
my turn to defend
urban didn't tame me
then my body memory kicks in
all bosoms and embraces
oral, anal entrances
enjoy the satisfaction
if the other is growing

who would have known
that a boy like him
would have entered me lightly
restoring my blisses?
who would have known
that a boy like him
after sharing my core
would stay going nowhere?
who would have known
a beauty this immense?
who would have known
a saintly trance?
who would have known
miraculous breath?
to inhale a beard
loaded with courage
who would have known
that a boy like him

if your eyes are closed
and if your eyes are opened
our love
if your eyes are shut
and if your eyes are opened
we have been together for five years
and love hasn't broken the bond
break the chain of love
and we're the ones who hurt her
you're the one who says she loves you
and the way she dresses you
you read all the books she has been reading
books that say she loves you
books that say she loves you
you read them obsessively
listening to what she writes
the body memory of her youth
younger boys are read than ever before
and they say they want to follow in the footsteps of her

let's sneak out of this party
it's getting boring
there's more to life than this

he covers his mouth with his palm
then he slowly undoes the taste
i feel myself broken
he sets his watch to a comet's orbit
and then he returns it
his fingers, they are theographers
they have beenchers in museums
and if one attempts
one will eventually lose faith
and will eventually lose faith in themselves

i have a recurrent dream
every time i lose my voice
i swallow little glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me
during the nights
they do a trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above my bed
while i'm asleep
my mother and son pour into me
warm glowing oil
into my wide open throat
i have a recurrent dream
every time i feel a hoarseness
i swallow warm glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me, oh
they make me feel so much better
they make me feel better
we have a recurrent dream
every time we lose our voices
we dream we swallow little lights
our mother and son bakes for us

until they're in the sky
right above our heads

genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
so warm
sounds go through the muscles
these abstract, wordless movements
move, move, move, move, move
they start off cells that haven't been touched before
these cells are virgins
waking up slowly waking up
waking up slowly wake up
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
nothing will be the same
i'm asleep
i'm fast asleep
i like this resonance
it elevates me
i don't recognise myself

i shuffle around the tectonic plates in my chest
you know i gave it all
try to match our continents
to change seasonal shift
to form a mutual core
as fast as your fingernail grows
the atlantic ridge drifts
to counteract distance
you know i gave it all
can you hear the effort
of the magnetic strife?
shuffling of columns
to form a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
you hid the key to our continuity
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know
what you resist persists
nuance makes heat
to counteract distance
i know you gave it all
offered me harmony
if things were done your way
my eurasian plate subsumed
forming a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation

she always knows when people need stroking
and is attracted to deathbeds and divorces
i dreamt she cared for my dying grandfather
lying naked face down on his bed
she insists on total presence
and knows how to get through to the rest of us
she has entered me thousandfold often
and undone knots at my most awkward
music, music loves too
she reaches out to orphans and refugees
embraces them with thermal blankets
her favourite childhood moments
were at a hospital for the disabled
i've seen her offer empathy to widows
she attends funerals of strangers
her strongest memory
is feeding children with leprosy
music heals too
i'm here to defend it

asking directions with the same beard as yours
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
isn't it odd?
isn't it peculiar?

shuffling your features
assembling a man
googling love
warming my heart on this log fire of love
features creatures

first snow of winter
i'm walking hills and valleys
adore this mystical fog!
this fucking mist!
these cliffs are just showing off!
then the body memory kicks in
i mime my home mountains
the moss that i'm made of
i redeem myself
i've been wrestling my fate
do i accept this ending?
will i accept my death
or struggle claustrophobic?
fought like a wolverine
with my destiny
refuse to accept what was meant to be
then the body memory kicks in
and i trust the unknown
unfathomable imagination
surrender to future
oh, how to capture all this love
and find a pathway for it
like threading an ocean through a needle
river through a keyhole
can't fathom the grasp
i can't grasp the fathom
then my body memory kicks in
my limbs and tongue take over
like the ancestors before me
show me the flow
my sexual dna
x-rays of my kama sutras
summons different bodies
compares spines and buttocks
and back of necks
then my body memory kicks in
it simply takes over
bestiality
i redeem my body
i wasn't born urban
toxic doesn't agree with me
love lured me here
into a stagnant state
my myths, my customs, ridiculed
vacuum packed molecules
then my body memory kicks in
on this brooklyn dance floor
sweating with these rhythms
rotate this matrix
all trapped in legal

try to match our continents
to change seasonal shift
to form a mutual core
as fast as your fingernail grows
the atlantic ridge drifts
to counteract distance
you know i gave it all
can you hear the effort
of the magnetic strife?
shuffling of columns
to form a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
you hid the key to our continuity
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know
what you resist persists
nuance makes heat
to counteract distance
i know you gave it all
offered me harmony
if things were done your way
my eurasian plate subsumed
forming a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know
====================
my elastic
it's gushing warm water
down my clit
through my fingers
through my toes
i'm sucking on your skin
and on your clit
it grows on you
i'm sucking on your skin
and on your clit
it grows on you
i'm sucking on your skin
and on your clit
it grows on you

i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is where i'm staying
this is my home
i live by the ocean

one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it will all come true
one day
when you're ready
one day, one day
when you're up to it
the atmosphere
will get lighter
and two suns ready
to shine just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it will all make sense
one day
you will blossom
one day, one day
when you're ready
an aeroplane
will curve gracefully
around the volcano
with the eruption that never lets you down
i can feel it
i can feel it
and the beautifullest
fireworks are burning
in the sky, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh
just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day

genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
so warm
sounds go through the muscles
these abstract, wordless movements
move, move, move, move, move
they start off cells that haven't been touched before
these cells are virgins
waking up slowly waking up
waking up slowly wake up
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
nothing will be the same
i'm asleep
i'm fast asleep
i like this resonance
it elevates me
i don't recognise myself
this is very interesting
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
i'm fast asleep now
you're still with me
i'm fast asleep
i'm asleep
my headphones
they saved, saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

his embrace, a fortress
it fuels me and places
a skeleton of trust
right beneath us
bone by bone
stone by stone
if you ask yourself patiently and carefully:
who is it? who is it?
who is it that never lets you down?
who is it that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are, they're going around
now they're handing it over
they're handing it over, handing it over
who is it that never lets you down?
who is it that gave you back your crown?

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
and enjoy every bit of you
of you
i see who you are
i see who you... are...

we live on a mountain
right at the top
there's a beautiful view
from the top of themountain
everymorning i walktowards the edge
and throw little thingsoff
like car parts, bottles and cutlery
or whatever i find lying around
it's become a habit
a way to start the day
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
it's real early morning
no one is awake
i'm back at my cliff
still throwing things off
i listen to sounds they make
on their way down
i follow with my eyes till they crash
i imagine what my body would sound like
slamming against those rocks
and when it lands
will my eyes be closed or open?
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you

suggests exciting sex
his fingers, they focus on her

saying, "let's free this girl!"
or something
like that
once again
a beautiful morning
the words i slowly put together
do not flow easily, they only fill my heart
recently, fulfilling
your heart's desire
you removed the whaling
moratorium
your voice is hoarse
and it is broken
in the whale's den

get over the sorrow, girl
the world is always going to be made of this
you can trust in it
unless you breathe in
bravely
i adore how you simply surrender to high
and your lungs, they're mourning
t-b style
all the stillborn love that could've happened
all the moments you should have embraced
all the moments you should have not locked up
understand so clearly:
to shut yourself up
would be the hugest crime of them all
hugest crime of them all
you're just crying after all
to not want them humans around
anymore
get over that sorrow, girl
get over it

hollow
my ancestors have access
hollow
i'm falling down the abyss
hollow
looking for some answers
generations of mothers sailing in
somehow they all were shipfolks
hollow
the ground is opening up
swallows me up
the trunk of dna
the trunk of dna, trunk
now come forth, all species
hollow
like a bead in necklace
thread me upon this chain
i'm part of it, ohh
the everlasting necklace
jewels after jewels after jewels after
jewels after jewels after jewels
i yearn to belong
let me belong
let me belong

best way to start-a-new
is to fail miserably
fail at loving and fail at giving
fail at creating a flow
then realign the whole
and kick into the start hole

to risk all is the end-all and the beginning all
to risk all is the end-all and the beginning all

not 'til you halo all over me
i'll come over

embraces all
so you can sleep
foetus-style

'cause we're asking for help
and the luminous beam - it feeds you!

i have walked this earth
and watched people
it doesn't scare me at all
i can be sincere
and say i like them
it doesn't scare me at all
you can't say no to hope
can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
i want to go on a mountain top
with a radio and good batteries
and play a joyous tune and
free the human race
from suffering
it doesn't scare me at all
i'm no fucking buddhist
but this is enlightenment
the less room you give me
the more space i've got
it doesn't scare me at all
you can't say no to hope
can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
i want to be on a mountain top
with a radio and good batteries
and play a joyous tune and
free the human race
from suffering
it doesn't scare me at all
this is an alarm-call
so wake up, wake up now
today has never happened
and it doesn't frighten me
it doesn't scare me at all
you can't say no to hope
you can't say no to happiness

i wish this be enough
i wish i only love you
i wish simplicity
look at the speed out there
it magnetizes me to it
and i have no fear
i'm only into this to
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
i wish i'd only look
and didn't have to touch
i wish i'd only smell this
and didn't have to taste
how can i ignore?
this is sex without touching
i'm going to explore
i'm only into this to
enjoy

i will wade out till my thighs
are steeped in burning flowers
i will take the sun in my mouth
and leap into the ripe air alive
with closed eyes
to dash against darkness
in the sleeping curves of my body
i shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
with chasteness of seagirls
will i complete the mystery of my flesh?
will i complete the mystery of my flesh, my flesh?

i walk through this land
stake a claim
with my sense
with my bark
mark my nest with song
hear the, the echo, echo from that cliff
i draw laser line through lake
to take physicality
i inhale this physicality
this forest is in me
this forest is in me
i immerse me
this is my home
this is, this is my home

i love your eyes, my dear

the nerves are sending shimmering signals
all through my fingers
the veins support
blood that gushes impulsively towards
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the stubborn trunks of these legs of mine
serve as pathways for my favourite fuel
heading upwards towards my kidneys
that celebrate
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
smooth soft red velvety lungs
are pushing a network of oxygen joyfully
through a nose, through a mouth
but all enjoys, all enjoys
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart

it's tricky when
you feel someone
has done something
on your behalf
it's slippery when
your sense of justice
murmurs underneath
and is asking you:
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
with a palm full of stars
i throw them like dice repeatedly
on the table repeat, repeatedly
i shake them like dice
and throw them on the table
repeatedly repeatedly
until the desired constellation appears
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right now?
and you hear: how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right now?
how am i going to make it right now?
how am i going to make it right now?
how am i going to make it right now?

on their way down

slamming against those rocks
and when it lands
will my eyes be closed or open?

weaving a deal
to get the biggest out of each other
we were never really together
we just hung out together
it's just that something like that happens
every time you go to a party
or a show
or a dance
you go to a place
that's glamor-free
and everyone is glamor-free
you can always go downtown
when you've got worries, all is filled with love
you can always go downtown
when you've got worries, all is filled with love
you've got to keep your cool
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic

but yet so, yet so irresistible
and there is no map
they're terribly, terribly, terribly moody
oh, human behaviour
then all of a sudden turn happy
but, oh, to get involved in the fun
is ever so, ever so satisfying
and there is no map
human behaviour, human, human

heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me, make me wonder
they say back then our universe was an empty sea
until a silver fox and her cunning mate
began to sing a song that became the world we know
heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me, make me wonder
and they say back then our universe was a cold black egg
until the god inside burst out and from its shattered shell
he made what became the world we know
heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me, make me wonder
and they say back then our universe was an endless land
until our ancestors woke up and before they went back to sleep
they carved it all into the world we know
heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me, make me wonder
and they say back then our universe wasn’t even there
until a sudden bang and then there was light, was sound, was matter
and it all became the world we know
heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me and dance eternal

i am strong in his hands, i am beyond me
on my own, i am human, and i do faults
i do confess, i feel you trickling
down my shoulders from above
i turn myself in, i give myself up
volunteer, you own me i'm yours
you have to trust it, i'm eternally yours
all that i gave them, i gave to you
so needy of comfort, but too raw to be embraced
undo this privacy and put me in my place
generous palmstroke: the hugest of hugs
undo this privacy, embrace
embrace me
embrace me
embrace me

i am strong in his hands, i am above
way beyond me, i can't...

to get to be the generous one
is the strongest stance
the pleasure is all mine
to finally let go
and evenly flow
who gives most

who gives most
the pleasure is all mine

we strengthen most

i love your eyes, my dear
their splendid sparkling fire
when suddenly you raise them so
to cast a swift embracing glance
like lightning flashing in the sky
but there's a charm that is greater still:
when my love's eyes are lowered
when all is fired by passions kiss
and through the downcast lashes
i see the dull flame of desire
and through the downcast lashes

i wish i'd only look
and didn't have to touch
i wish i'd only smell this
and didn't have to taste
how can i ignore?
this is sex without touching
i'm going to explore
i'm only into this to

i will wade out till my thighs
are steeped in burning flowers
i will take the sun in my mouth
and leap into the ripe air alive
with closed eyes
to dash against darkness
in the sleeping curves of my body
i shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
with chasteness of seagirls
will i complete the mystery of my flesh?
will i complete the mystery of my flesh, my flesh?

i walk through this land
stake a claim
with my sense
with my bark
mark my nest with song
hear the, the echo, echo from that cliff
i draw laser line through lake
to take physicality
i inhale this physicality
this forest is in me
this forest is in me
i immerse me
this is my home
this is, this is my home

if there is a troubador washing: it is he
if there is a man about town: it is he
if there is one to be sought: it is he
if there are nine she's: they are bought for me
this way is as is she
and he placed her unclothed, long, long, long-legged
on top of the family tree
and if he has chosen the point while she is under him
then leave her coily placed crouched sucking him
for it is i
with her on knee
i leave her without pith or feel
and leave her be
leave it be, for he controls what there'll be
he makes his face known to none
for if he is seen, then all will
and all will know
know me

excuse me
but i just have to
explode
explode this body
off me
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
i'll be brand new
brand new tomorrow
a little bit tired
but brand new

oh, oh
darling, stop confusing me
with your wishful thinking
hopeful embraces
don't you understand?
i have to go through this
i belong to here where
no one cares, and no one loves
no light no air to live in
a place called hate
the city of fear
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
and the hurt stops
it's sometimes just like sleeping
curling up inside my private tortures
i nestle into pain
hug suffering
caress every ache
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting

like a virus needs a body
as soft tissue feeds on blood
some day i'll find you, the urge is here
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
like a mushroom on a tree trunk
as the protein transmutates
i knock on your skin, and i am in
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
the perfect match, you and
====================
the first blood of my children
the words i slowly put together
do not flow easily, they only fill my heart
recently, fulfilling
your heart's desire
you removed the whaling
moratorium
your gesture brings
a much needed food
to our community
and families
the words i slowly put together
do not flow easily, they only fill my heart
a million year old fossil
i send to you
this comes from my family
and the ancient sea
a prehistoric impression
of the modern krill
she feeds the noble whale
and offers you longevity
the words i slowly put together
do not flow easily, they only fill my heart
finally, please take good care in the heat
sincerely yours

it's called "life"
it goes wherever it wants to
don't try to predict it
then you'd offend it
it's meant to surprise

nature is ancient ancient

rescue me
from level-head-ness
and the unnecessary luxury of being calm
nature is ancient ancient

surprises us all ancient

always, always, always, always, always
a pretty rush down my spine
all those boys
with fascinating fingers
working, creating
touching their tools

always, always, always, always, always
a pretty rush down my spine
tell me stories
play me the tunes
that crack you up
gives me

a pretty rush down my spine

this mood might not happen often that i feel
i might breathe heavily, darling
but there’s so much hope
there is so much hope out there
i’ve been trying so hard
to complete all the puzzles
to create a flow
to get the current
the warmths we all know
the nurishment we all want feed on
we want to feed on
and then only sometime
with the right amount of tears in our eyes
and smiles on our lips
trance-like
we know, we know
we know it was all worth it
we know, we know
it was all for reason
let’s elevate, let's elevate
let's elevate above now, now, now, now, now!

skin slit, consensual knife
she cuts his figure, he flenses her field

everything just feels so wrong
everything is fine

best way to start-a-new
is to fail miserably
fail at loving and fail at giving
fail at creating a flow
then realign the whole
and kick into the start hole
and kick into the start hole

i'll come over
not 'til it shimmers 'round your skull
i'll be yours
i weave for you
the marvellous web

nourish, nourish
your turtleheart

don't, don't get angry with yourself
i'll heal you
with a razor blade
i'll cut a slit open
and the luminous beam
heals you honey, heals you
don't get angry with yourself
don't get angry with yourself

don't get angry with yourself
i'll heal you
i'll heal you

i have walked this earth
and watched people
it doesn't scare me at all
i can be sincere
and say i like them
it doesn't scare me at all
you can't say no to hope
can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
i want to go on a mountain top
with a radio and good batteries
and play a joyous tune and
free the human race
from suffering
it doesn't scare me at all
i'm no fucking buddhist
but this is enlightenment
the less room you give me
the more space i've got
it doesn't scare me at all
you can't say no to hope
can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
i want to be on a mountain top
with a radio and good batteries
and play a joyous tune and
free the human race
from suffering
it doesn't scare me at all
this is an alarm-call
so wake up, wake up now
today has never happened
and it doesn't frighten me
it doesn't scare me at all
you can't say no to hope
you can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all

i wish i want to stay here
i wish this be enough
i wish i only love you
i wish simplicity
look at the speed out there
it magnetizes me to it
and i have no fear
i'm only into this to
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
i wish i'd only look
and didn't have to touch
i wish i'd only smell this
and didn't have to taste
how can i ignore?
this is sex without touching
i'm going to explore
i'm only into this to
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy

i will wade out till my thighs
are steeped in burning flowers
i will take the sun in my mouth
and leap into the ripe air alive
with closed eyes
to dash against darkness
in the sleeping curves of my body
i shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
with chasteness of seagirls
will i complete the mystery of my flesh?
will i complete the mystery of my flesh, my flesh?

i walk through this land
stake a claim
with my sense
with my bark
mark my nest with song
hear the, the echo, echo from that cliff
i draw laser line through lake
to take physicality
i inhale this physicality
this forest is in me
this forest is in me
i immerse me
this is my home
this is, this is my home

if there is a troubador washing: it is he
if there is a man

sunday is gloomy, the hours are slumberless
dearest of shadows i live with are numberless
little white flowers will never awaken you
not where the dark coach of sorrow has taken you
angels have no thought of ever returning you
would they be angry if i thought of joining you?
gloomy sunday
gloomy sunday, with shadows i spend it all
my heart and i have decided to end it all
soon there'll be prayers and candles are lit, i know
let them not weep, let them know that i'm glad to go
death is a dream, for in death i'm caressing you
with the last breath of my soul, i'll be blessing you
gloomy sunday
dreaming
i was only dreaming
i awake and i find you asleep and deep in my heart
dear
darling, i hope that my dream hasn't haunted you
my heart is telling you how much i wanted you
gloomy sunday
it's absolutely gloomy sunday
gloomy sunday

or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i will meet you
i was peaking
but it hasn't happened yet
i haven't been given
my best souvenir

this man is fierce
he invents a virus
that makes you want to burn
it's the spark that ignites me

how do i master
the trickiest part?
it's come to
this:
we were all slightly
off-guard once again
when suddenly
the hurricane of
phalaen
hides us
in a misty blue lake
crystalline
mud doth armored
state like monarchy
with kings and queens
and the press release they
release
every time a priest
comes forward
to share their
biographies of saints
crystalline
lulled me to sleep
and at night
when the angels sing
corrupted water
falls of purest intensity
crystalline
i can't say no to hope
i can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
i can't say no to hope

i have a recurrent dream
every time i lose my voice
i swallow little glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me
during the nights
they do a trapeze walk
until they're in the

a pattern to follow
a secret code carved
to protect against chance
the future lies in your hands

i find myself out gazing at stars
hearing guitars
like someone in love
sometimes the things i do astound me
mostly whenever you're around me
lately
i seem to walk as though i have wings
bump into things
like someone in love
each time i look at you, i'm limp as a glove

underneath our feet
crystals grow like plants
listen how they grow
i'm blinded by the lights
listen how they grow
in the core of the earth
listen how they glow
crystalline
internal nebula
crystalline
rocks growing slow-mo

i conquer claustrophobia
crystalline
and demand the light
we mimic the openness
of the ones we love
dovetail our generosity
equalize the flow
with our hearts
we chisel quartz
to reach love

one breath away from mother oceania
your nimble feet make prints in my sands
you have done good for yourselves
since you left my wet embrace
and crawled ashore
every boy is a snake, is a lily
every pearl is a lynx, is a girl
sweet like harmony made into flesh
you dance by my side
children sublime
you show me continents
i see islands
you count the centuries
i blink my eyes
hawks and sparrows race in my waters
stingrays are floating
across the sky
little ones, my sons and my daughters
your sweat is salty
i am why, i am why
i am why
your sweat is salty
i am why, i am why
i am why, i am why

go in and out of locomotives
all alone

and people everywhere
crying 'cause i need you
crying i can feel you
crying 'cause i need you

it's a hot day and i'm dressed lightly
i move carefully through the crowd
here everyone is so vulnerable
and i'm as well

day after day
alone on a hill
the strange guy
where the rooster crowed
no one wants to know about him
and they point where he goes
he still holds out alone
do you know about a fool on a hill
he can see a precious sun
and his eyes see more
they see a world, a hidden world
ask him for help
he comes quickly
he that has thousand voices
whisper the truth quickly
no one wants to listen to him
or the sound in a secret song
which he doesn't know at all
do you know about a fool on a hill
no one wants to see him
in the hut in the south with a lake
he still holds out alone

no one wants to listen to him
and they point where he goes
he still holds out alone

down in the cellar in the boho zone
i went looking for some sweet inspiration, oh well
just another hard time band with negro affectations
i was a hopeful in rooms like this
when i was working cheap
it's an old romance, the boho dance
hasn't gone to sleep
but even on the scuffle
the cleaner's press was in my jeans
and any eye for detail
caught a little lace along the seams
and you

i'm trying my best to make the best of your absence
though the day seems long since over
i'm so broken
i can't get no
thank you
i can't get no
why?
what's the lesser of two evils?
a mountain of dust
falling
like rain, out of the blue
my alarm clock goes off
my bookshelf unstained
fall is coming
i'm trying my best to make amends
but the evening unfolds in my mind's eye
do nothing
i'm distracted by thoughts of
losing my mind's eye
i'm trying my best to make sense of
the situation
i'm trying my best to make sense of
the moment
is coming to an end
i'm trying my best to make sense of
the moment

shelter you
from that pain
just to make it easier on you
you are gonna have to find out for yourself

blueberries, dancers in line
cobwebs, a bakery sign

oh - dancers in line
oh
if living is seeing
i'm holding my breath
in wonder - i wonder
what happens next?
a new world, a new day to see
see, see - i'm softly walking on air
halfway to heaven from here
sunlight unfolds in my hair - it grows slowly
i'm walking on air
halfway to heaven from here
he's walking on air

he's walking on air
i'm gonna be fine - heh heh heh
how am i gonna be?
how am i gonna be?

i'm just trying to make sense of it all
nature is waiting

a juxtapositioning fate
find our mutual coordinates
moments of clarity are so rare
i better document this
at last the view is fierce
all that matters is
who is open chested
and who has coagulated
who can share and
who has shut down the chances?
show me emotional respect, oh respect, oh respect
and i have emotional needs, oh needs, oh ooh
i wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, oh ooh
what is it that i have
that makes me feel your pain?
like milking a stone
to get you to say it
who is open?
and who has shut up
and if one feels closed
how does one stay open?
we have emotional needs, oh needs, oh needs, oh ooh

we live on a mountain
right at the top
there's a beautiful view
from the top of the mountain
every morning i walk towards the edge
and throw little things off
like car parts, bottles and cutlery
or whatever i find lying around
it's become a habit
a way to start the day
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
it's early morning
no one is awake
i'm back at my cliff
still throwing things off
i listen to the sounds they make
on their way down
i follow with my eyes till they crash
i imagine what my body would sound like
slamming against those rocks
and when it lands
will my eyes be closed or open?
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier

get over the sorrow, girl
the world is always going to be made of this
you can trust in it
unless you breathe in
bravely
i adore how you simply surrender to high
and your lungs, they're mourning
t-b style
all the stillborn love that could've happened
all the moments you should have embraced
all the moments you should have not locked up
understand so clearly:
to shut yourself up
would be the hugest crime of them all
hugest crime of them all
you're just crying after all
to not want them humans around
anymore
get over that sorrow, girl
get over it

genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
so warm
sounds go through the muscles
these abstract, wordless movements
move, move, move, move, move
they start off cells that haven't been touched before
these cells are virgins
waking up slowly waking up
waking up slowly wake up
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
nothing will be the same
i'm asleep
i'm fast asleep
i like this resonance
it elevates me
i don't recognise myself
this is very interesting
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
i'm fast asleep now
you're still with me
i'm fast asleep
i'm asleep
my headphones
they saved, saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

i shuffle around the tectonic plates in my chest
you know i gave it all
try to match our continents
to change seasonal shift
to form a mutual core
as fast as your fingernail grows
the atlantic ridge drifts
to counteract distance
you know i gave it all
can you hear the effort
of the magnetic strife?
shuffling of columns
to form a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know
what you resist persists
nuance makes heat
to counteract distance
i know you gave it all
offered me harmony
if things were done your way
my eurasian plate subsumed
forming a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know i had it in me
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know



his embrace, a fortress
it fuels me and places
a skeleton of trust
right beneath us
bone by bone
stone by stone
if you ask yourself patiently and carefully:
who is it? who is it?
who is it that never lets you down?
who is it that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are, they're going around
now they're handing it over
they're handing it over, handing it over
who is it that never lets you down?
who is it that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are, they're going around
now they're handing it over
handing it over
handing it over...
he demands a closeness
we all have earned a lightness
carry my joy on the left
carry my pain on the right
if you ask yourself now, patiently and carefully:
who is it?
who is it that never lets you down?
who is it that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are, they're going around
and they're handing it over
handing it over, handing
who is it that never lets you down?
who is it that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are, they're going around
now i'm handing it over
handing it over

this small town hasn't got room

i, i, i, i miss you
i had a dream that i was missing you, indeed
and if i miss you then you know that i'll be there with speed
i got that mystical vibe for your mind, believe
i've never seen you but i've seen you got the vibes i need
that's why i miss ya, can't dismiss ya from my mind miss you
only  ya but i seek to find
you got to send me an emotion, or a sign
'cause even though we know all things must reveal in time
still i miss ya miss you, miss you
i get so impatient
i can't stand the wait
when will i get my cuddle?
who are you?
i know by now that you'll arrive
by the time i stop waiting
miss you
i miss you
so, i miss you
i miss you
miss you, miss you, miss you
miss you, miss you

why do i love it so much?
what kind of magic is this?
how come out of all the people in the world
only one can make me complete?
one word, one word on the phone
makes me happy
one touch, but one touch directly
makes me ecstatic
miss you, miss you
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
oh i get impatient
i can't stand the wait
when will i get my cuddle?
how many fingers can you give me?
let's hope so
that i can join you
i'm not taming no animal
and i don't want to be
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
oh i get impatient
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
oh i get impatient
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
oh i get impatient
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
oh i get impatient
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
safe up here with me
i'll stay in a hidden place
like a moth alone
it goes through all of its preparation
and when it lashes out again
i will find its hiding place
moth is made of steel
when it lashes out again
i will find its hiding place
moth is made of wood
when it lashes out again
i will find its hiding place
moth is made of earth
when it lashes out again
i will find its hiding place
moth is made of stone
when it lashes out again
i will find its hiding place
moth is made of earth
when it lashes out again
i will find its hiding place

one breath away from mother oceania
your nimble feet make prints in my sands
you have done good for yourselves
since i left your wet embrace
and crawled ashore
every boy is a snake, is a lily
every pearl is a lynx, is a girl
sweet like harmony made into flesh
you dance by my side
children sublime
you show me continents
i see islands
you count the centuries
i blink my eyes
hawks and sparrows race in my waters
stingrays are floating
across the sky
little ones, my sons and my daughters
your sweat is salty
i am why, i am why
i am why
your sweat is salty
i am why, i am why
i am why, i am why

the little boy who says his prayers
good god don't go away from mommy
she undresses me and bathes and stays with me
then she dresses me in warm nightgown
god bless daddy 'cause i forgot
when i think of what happened today
a little song comes to mind
i must not stop saying my prayer
forgive me god, i ask you kindly
my nightgown has a hood
inside the hood i hide my head
it covers my eyes and my forehead as well
nobody knows that i am there
thank you god for a good day
did i forget something, what was it?
i prayed for daddy and thought of you
yes now i remember - god bless me
the little boy sleeps well now
the day is over, the night has come
hush - quiet - what?

einn, tveir, þrír
i'm aiming too high
but the dance is over
and the lights are back on
don't get angry with yourself - just respect that
you're much, much, much more

i have a recurrent dream
every time i lose my voice
i swallow little glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me
during the nights
they do a trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above my bed
while i'm asleep
my mother and son pour into me
warm glowing oil
into my wide open throat
i have a recurrent dream
every time i feel a hoarseness
i swallow warm glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me, oh
they make me feel so much better
they make me feel better
we have a recurrent dream
every time we lose our voices
we dream we swallow little lights
our mother and son bakes for us
during the nights
they do a little trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above our heads
while we're asleep
my mother and son pour into us
pour into us
warm glowing oil
into our wide open throats
i have a recurrent dream
they make me feel better
they make me feel better

i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is where i'm staying
this is my home
i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down

that i won't drown

i live by the ocean
and during the night
i'm seen gathering around a ship
fleet-free
nature is watchful
she's gathering herself
to protect us
fireworks are burning
in the sky, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh
just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
yours is my vocal
i can feel it
i can feel it

one day
you will blossom
one day, one day

an aeroplane
will curve gracefully
around the volcano
with the eruption that never lets you down

genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
so warm
sounds go through the muscles
these abstract, wordless movements
move, move, move, move, move
they start off cells that haven't been touched before
these cells are virgins
waking up slowly waking up
waking up slowly wake up
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
nothing will be the same
i'm asleep
i'm fast asleep
i like this resonance
it elevates me
i don't recognise myself
this is very interesting
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
i'm fast asleep now
you're still with me
i'm fast asleep
i'm asleep
my headphones
they saved, saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

i shuffle around the tectonic plates in my chest
you know i gave it all
try to match our continents
to change seasonal shift
to form a mutual core
as fast as your fingernail grows
the atlantic ridge drifts
to counteract distance
you know i gave it all
can you hear the effort
of the magnetic strife?
shuffling of columns
to form a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
you hid the key to our continuity
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know
what you resist persists
nuance makes heat
to counteract distance
i know you gave it all
offered me harmony
if things were done your way
my eurasian plate subsumed
forming a mutual core
====================
we're all still wet
longing and yearning
repeat after me:
sweetly
i remember you
sweetly
i remember you
sweetly
i remember you
sweetly
i remember you
sweetly
i remember you
sweetly
i remember you
sweetly
i remember you
sweetly
i remember you

while you are away
my heart comes undone
slowly unravels
in a ball of yarn
the devil collects it
with a grin
our love
in a ball of yarn
the devil collects it
with a grin
our love
in a ball of yarn
he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love
he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love
while you are away
my heart comes undone
slowly unravels
in a ball of yarn
the devil collects it
with a grin
our love, our love
in a ball of yarn
the devil collects it
with a grin
our love, our love
in a ball of yarn
the devil collects it

you are gonna have to find out for yourself
it's gonna be hard
if you don't want to find out
it's gonna be hard
if you don't want to accept
the world is your oyster
and i will fill it
and take it shelter from here
sunlight beckons
to find you hiding
holographic paradigm
the beauty in schematic
it's gonna be hard, it's fuckin' hard
if you don't want to find out
it's gonna be hard, it's gonna be hard
if you don't want to accept
the beauty in schematic
i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones

we live on a mountain
right at the top
there's a beautiful view
from the top of themountain
everymorning i walktowards the edge
and throw little thingsoff
like car parts, bottles and cutlery
or whatever i find lying around
it's become a habit
a way to start the day
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
it's real early morning
no one is awake
i'm back at my cliff
still throwing things off
i listen to sounds they make
on their way down
i follow with my eyes till they crash
i imagine what my body would sound like
slamming against those rocks
and when it lands
will my eyes be closed or open?
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you

i draw laser line through lake
and extend it over bay
it will never cross my mind
i'll never forget it
the words i sent down
on the day
i left town
living by the ocean
watching the swell
come ashore
your momma always stays behind
to support
the baby
when she goes missing
you will never know
what happened to her?
or what happened to her love?
your mother's car
features the words "OUT OF LOVE" adorning the door
its windshield glass filled with messages
all of which were sent to me
one by one
your mother's car
features the words "OUT OF LOVE" adorning the door
her phone vibrates

lately
i find myself out gazing at stars
hearing guitars
like someone in love
sometimes the things i do astound me
mostly whenever you're around me
lately
i seem to walk as though i have wings
bump into things
like someone in love
each time i look at you, i'm limp as a glove
and feeling like someone in love
sometimes the things i do astound me
mostly whenever you're around me
lately
i seem to walk as though i have wings
bump into things
like someone in love
each time i look at you, i'm limp as a glove
and feeling like someone in love

underneath our feet
crystals grow like plants
listen how they grow
i'm blinded by the lights
listen how they grow
in the core of the earth
listen how they glow
crystalline
internal nebula
crystalline
rocks growing slow-mo
crystalline
i conquer claustrophobia
crystalline
and demand the light
we mimic the openness
of the ones we love
dovetail our generosity
equalize the flow
with our hearts
we chisel quartz
to reach love
crystalline
internal nebula
crystalline
rocks growing slow-mo
crystalline
i conquer claustrophobia
crystalline
and demand the light
octagon, polygon
pipes up an organ
sonic branches
murmuring drone
crystallizing galaxies
spread out like my fingers

rocks growing slow-mo
crystalline
i conquer claustrophobia
crystalline
and demand the light

one breath away from mother oceania

hollow
the ground is opening up
swallows me up
the trunk of dna
the trunk of dna, trunk
now come forth, all species
hollow
like a bead in necklace
thread me upon this chain
i'm part of it, ohh
the everlasting necklace
jewels after jewels after jewels after
jewels after jewels after jewels
i yearn to belong
let me belong
let me belong

up on the toe
there is a view
up on the toe
and the spine
straight and erect
hungry and curious
up on the toe
looking forward to
the air is thinner here
she came here
to lose face
got down on her knees
the beast is back!
on four legs
set her clock to the moon
raises her spine
vertebrae by vertebrae
up on the toe
looking
i have been filled with steam for months, for years
same old cloud, claustrophobic me
let it burst like old train sounds
make them leave me nature
vertebrae by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
my arms ooze out of my shoulders!
and the arms ooze out of my shoulders
i curl my tail inwards, inwards
i set my clock on the moon
vertebrae by vertebrae
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
let off some steam

here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind
here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind

what's the lesser of two evils
if a suicide bomber made to look pregnant
manages to kill her target or not?
what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if she kills them or dies in vain?
nature has fixed no limits on our hopes
oh, what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if her bump was fake or if it was real?
here's my version of it
eternal whirlwind
i have fostered since childhood
well, i don't care
love is all
i dare to drown
to be proven wrong

when your eyes pause on the ball
that hangs on the third branch from the star
you remember why it is dark
and why it gets light again
the earth, like the heart, slopes in its seat
and, like that, it travels along an elliptical path
drawn into the darkness
an unpolished pearl
in sky-black palm of hand
flickering sun-flame
and then you remember
that you, yourself, you are a light-bearer, a light-bearer
receiving radiance from others
flickering sun-flame
unpolished earth in palm of hand

show me forgiveness
for having lost faith in myself
and let my own interior up
to inferior forces
the shame is endless
but if soon start forgiveness
the girl might live

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
i see who you are
i see who you.... are...

it may not always be so
and i say that if your lips
which i have loved
should touch another's
and your dear strong fingers clutch her heart
as mine in time not far away
if on another's face your sweet hair lay
in such a silence as i know
or such great writhing words as, uttering overmuch
stand helplessly before the spirit at bay
if this should be, i say if this should be
you of my heart, send me a little word
that i may go unto her, and take her hands saying
accept all happiness from me
then i shall turn my face
and hear one bird sing terribly afar in the lost lands

when will it be time to document?
do it now!
this submarine behaviour
do it now!
when time?
do it now!
to return
do it now!
do it now!
shake us out of the heavy deep sleep
shake us now!
do it
====================
it's wet in the middle
with a shell around it
it's called "life"
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
oh i
you've got to manage
i won't sympathize
anymore
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me
you're all right
there's nothing wrong
self-sufficience please!
and get to work
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me, army of me
army of me

when you're alone and life is making you lonely
you can always go downtown
when you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
seems to help, i know downtown
just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
how can you lose?
the lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
so go downtown
things'll be great when you're downtown
no finer place, for sure, downtown
everything's waiting for you
don't hang around and let your problems surround you
there are movie shows downtown
maybe you know some little places to go to
where they never close downtown
just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
you'll be dancing with him too before the night is over
happy again
the lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
so go downtown
where all the lights are bright downtown
waiting for you tonight downtown
you're gonna be all right now
and you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
guide them along
so maybe i'll see you there
we can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares
so go downtown
things'll be great when you're downtown
don't wait a minute for downtown
everything's waiting for you

come on girl
let's sneak out of this party
it's getting boring
there's more to life than this
it's still early morning

eitt sinn tók ég tali gamlan tötralegan mann
ég var á vappi niðri við höfn - á bryggjunni stóð hann
hann sagði mér frá landi einu, langt af leið það er
on nú er eins og eitthvað hafi brostið inní mér
alta mira - ævintýralanið er
alta mira - þangað hugurinn mig ber
alta mira - ævintýralanið er
alta mira - þangað hugurinn mig ber
sá gamli sagði mer þar sólin sægræn væri á lit
i sjónum spekingslegar syntu kýrnar út á hlið
hann seli sá í söngleik í silfurtitum skóm
um torgin töltu tífælur í kjólfötum með blóm
alta mira - ævintýralanið er
alta mira - þangað hugurinn mig ber
alta mira - ævintýralanið er
alta mira - þangað hugurinn mig ber
hæ - alta mira - lalalalala-lala

i have a recurrent dream
every time i lose my voice
i swallow little glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me
during the nights
they do a trapeze walk
until they're in the sky

while i'm asleep
my mother and son pour into me
warm glowing oil
into my wide open throat
i have a recurrent dream
every time i feel a hoarseness
i swallow warm glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me, oh

right above our heads
while we're asleep
my mother and son pour into us
pour into us
warm glowing oil
into our wide open throats
i have a recurrent dream
they make me feel better
they make me feel better

i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
====================
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

i shuffle around the tectonic plates in my chest
you remember me, do you?
i'm tall, i'm handsome
but there's a charm that you don't know about me
you know that i enjoy toying with my music
dear general macarthur of melodies
hid from its hiding place
on the surface simplicity, but when you put it into practice
it becomes the charm that i seek
to harness and to show off
i'm no different than any other
you know that i love to laugh
no, i don't
embrace the charm
you've got yourself in a fine mess there
you are supposed to be joking
but when you put it simply
its effectiveness as a charm is demonstrated
no matter the task
i can give myself up
no, i don't want to give myself up
let's open up: share this richness
of our being
who you are
get out of that cold embrace
and down to the nth percentile
of all the people in the world
and get to the top
what is the furthest away from home?
what is the furthest away from home?
what is the furthest away from home?
from top to bottom
your income is top to bottom
and the top one percent have earned more
from top to bottom
your income is top to bottom
and the top one percent have earned more
from top to bottom
your income is top to bottom
and the top one percent have earned more
from top to bottom
what is the furthest distance away from home?
what is the furthest distance away from home?
what is the furthest distance away from home?
what is the furthest distance away from home?
i'm a fountain of blood
in the shape of a girl
you're the bird on the brim
hypnotised by the whirl
drink me, make me feel real
wet your beak in the stream
game we're playing is life
love's a two way dream
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a path of cinders
burning under your feet
you're the one who walks me
i'm your one way street
i'm a whisper in the water
secret for you to hear
you're the one who grows distant
when i beckon you near
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a tree that grows hearts
one for each that you take
you're the intruder's hand
i'm the branch that you break

my healed chest wound
transformed into a gate
where i receive love from
where i give love from
and i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
split into many parts
splattered light beams into prisms
that will reunite
if you care for me, care for me
if you care for me, care for me
care for me, care for me
and then i'll care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
didn't used to be so needy
just more broken than normal
proud self-sufficiency
my silhouette is oval
it is a gate
i can care for you, care for you from
i can care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
you care for me, care for me
care for you

shh, shh
it's oh, so quiet, shh, shh
it's oh, so still, shh, shh
you're all alone, shh, shh
and so peaceful until
you fall in love, zing boom
the sky up above, zing boom
is caving in, wow bam!
you've never been so nuts about a guy
you wanna laugh, you wanna cry
you cross your heart and hope to die
till it's over, and then, shh, shh
it's nice and quiet, shh, shh
but soon again, shh, shh
starts another big riot

i've seen it all, i have seen the trees
i've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
i've seen a man killed by his best friend
and lives that were over before they were spent
i've seen what i was — i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru!
i'm happy to say i had better to do
what about china? have you seen the great wall?
all walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!
and the man you will marry?
the home you will share?
to be honest, i really don't care...
you've never been to niagara falls?
i have seen water, it's water, that's all...
the eiffel tower, the empire state?
my pulse was as high on my very first date!
your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?
to be honest, i really don't care...
i've seen it all, i've seen the dark
i've seen the brightness in one little spark
i've seen what i chose and i've seen what i need
and that is enough, to want more would be greed
i've seen what i was and i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you've seen it all and all you have seen
you can always review on your own little screen
the light and the dark, the big and the small
just keep in mind — you need no more

====================
so, when i wake you up
i'm naked and laughing it out of
the eyes of the world to see
you're trying too hard
to be a hero
but it doesn't work that way
it doesn't scare me at all
i'm going to prove the impossible exists
it doesn't scare me at all
you can't say no to hope
you can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
i'm going to prove the impossible exists
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all

i wish i want to stay here
i wish this be enough
i wish i only love you
i wish simplicity
look at the speed out there
it magnetizes me to it
and i have no fear
i'm only into this to
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
i wish i'd only look
and didn't have to touch
i wish i'd only smell this
and didn't have to taste
how can i ignore?
this is sex without touching
i'm going to explore
i'm only into this to
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy

i will wade out till my thighs
are steeped in burning flowers
i will take the sun in my mouth
and leap into the ripe air alive
with closed eyes
to dash against darkness
in the sleeping curves of my body
i shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
with chasteness of seagirls
will i complete the mystery of my flesh?
will i complete the mystery of my flesh, my flesh?

i walk through this land
stake a claim
with my sense
with my bark
mark my nest with song
hear the, the echo, echo from that cliff
i draw laser line through lake
to take physicality
i inhale this physicality
this forest is in me
this forest is in me
i immerse me
this is my home
this is, this is my home

if there is a troubador washing: it is he
if there is a man about town: it is he
if there is one to be sought: it is he
if there are nine she's: they are bought for me
this way is as is she
and he placed her unclothed, long, long, long-legged
on top of the family tree
and if he has chosen the point while she is under him
then leave her coily placed crouched sucking him
for it is i
with her on knee
i leave her without pith or feel
and leave her be
leave it be, for he controls what there'll be
he makes his face known to none
for if he is seen, then all will
and all will know
know me

excuse me
but i just have to
explode
explode this body
off me
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
i'll be brand new
brand new tomorrow
a little bit tired
but brand new
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
oaaahh!!!

oh, oh
darling, stop confusing me
with your wishful thinking
hopeful embraces
don't you understand?
i have to go through this
i belong to here where
no one cares, and no one loves
no light no air to live in
a place called hate
the city of fear
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
and the hurt stops
it's sometimes just like sleeping
curling up inside my private tortures
i nestle into pain
hug suffering
caress every ache
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting

like a virus needs a body
as soft tissue feeds on blood
some day i'll find you, the urge is here
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
like a mushroom on a tree trunk
as the protein transmutates
i knock on your skin, and i am in
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
ooo-ooo-ooo-

i have fostered since childhood
well on its own doesn't really scare me at all
there's just no fear
i'm no vampire
no, i'd never be
a vampire
a little girl
would burst out laughing
when she was alone and alone
with a gun
drawn
into the water
asking for water
to get under the skin
i draw my breath
less
i haven't felt this good before
and if i don't get used to it
i'll get into trouble
i won't get out of this
without a little kindness
from among the villagers
our hut is forked into the sea
and the shore is forked into the sky
i'm going in search of some kind of knowledge
somehow i'm born waterproof
the air is bubblegum and the ground is forked into the sky
this is the world i'm living in
he's totally free
he can't get out of this
he's not held hostage
he's not stuck in a bubble
he's not stuck in a dilemma
he's not stuck in a show-stopper
he's not stuck in a crime of passion
he's not stuck in a pornographic movie
he's not stuck in a dna-edna-editing house
he's not stuck in a sex shop sign-off
he's not stuck in a sex shop bondage
till it's over, and then: it's nice and quiet but soon to be full-blown adult
it's not going to be the happy ending it seems
it's not going to be happy ending
it's not going to be the happy ending
it's not going to be the happy ending in the sense that it doesn't
make sense at all
to be stuck in a circle of love
it doesn't make sense at all
i'm going in to try to make some dough
to try to make some dough
it doesn't make sense at all
to be stuck in a circle of love
it doesn't make sense at all
it doesn't make sense at all
it doesn't make sense at all
it doesn't make sense at all
it doesn't make sense at all
it doesn't make sense at all
it doesn't make sense at all

sunday is gloomy, the hours are slumberless
dearest of shadows i live with are numberless
little white flowers will never awaken you
not where the dark coach of sorrow has taken you
angels have no thought of ever returning you
would they be angry if i thought of joining you?
gloomy sunday
gloomy sunday, with shadows i spend it all
my heart and i have decided to end it all
soon there'll be prayers and candles are lit, i know
let them not weep, let them know that i'm glad to go
death is a dream, for in death i'm caressing you
with the last breath of my soul, i'll be blessing you
gloomy sunday
dreaming
i was only dreaming
i awake and i find you asleep and deep in my heart
dear
darling, i hope that my dream hasn't haunted you
my heart is telling you how much i wanted you
gloomy sunday
it's absolutely gloomy sunday

get over the sorrow, girl
the world is always going to be made of this
you can trust in it
unless you breathe in
bravely
i adore how you simply surrender to high
and your lungs, they're mourning
t-b style
all the stillborn love that could've happened
all the moments you should have embraced
all the moments you should have not locked up
understand so clearly:
to shut yourself up
would be the hugest crime of them all
hugest crime of them all
you're just crying after all
to not want them humans around
anymore
get over that sorrow, girl
get over it

hollow
my ancestors have access
hollow
i'm falling down the abyss
hollow
looking for some answers
generations of mothers sailing in
somehow they all were shipfolks
hollow
the ground is opening up
swallows me up
the trunk of dna
the trunk of dna, trunk
now come forth, all species
hollow
like a bead in necklace
thread me upon this chain
i'm part of it, ohh
the everlasting necklace
jewels after jewels after jewels after
jewels after jewels after jewels
i yearn to belong
let me belong
let me belong

my heart is so broken

it will never catch up with me
i'm so broken

get over the sorrow, girl
the world is always going to be made of this
you can trust in it
unless you breathe in
bravely
i adore how you simply surrender to high
and your lungs, they're mourning
t-b style
all the stillborn love that could've happened
all the moments you should have embraced
all the moments you should have not locked up
understand so clearly:
to shut yourself up
would be the hugest crime of them all
hugest crime of them all
you're just crying after all
to not want them humans around
anymore
get over that sorrow, girl
get over it

hollow
my ancestors have access
hollow
i'm falling down the abyss
hollow
looking for some answers
generations of mothers sailing in
somehow they all were shipfolks
hollow
the ground is opening up
swallows me up
the trunk of dna
the trunk of dna, trunk
now come forth, all species
hollow
like a bead in necklace
thread me upon this chain
i'm part of it, ohh
the everlasting necklace
jewels after jewels after jewels after
jewels after jewels after jewels
i yearn to belong
let me belong
let me belong

lately
i find myself out gazing at stars
hearing guitars
like someone in love
sometimes the things i do astound me
mostly whenever you're around me
lately
i seem to walk as though i have wings
bump into things
like someone in love
each time i look at you, i'm limp as a glove
and feeling like someone in love
sometimes the things i do astound me
mostly whenever you're around me
lately
i seem to walk as though i have wings
bump into things
like someone in love
each time i look at you, i'm limp as a glove
and feeling like someone in love
like someone in love

underneath our feet
crystals grow like plants
listen how they grow
i'm blinded by the lights
listen how they grow
in the core of the earth
listen how they glow
crystalline
internal nebula
crystalline
rocks growing slow-mo
crystalline
i conquer claustrophobia
crystalline
and demand the light
crystalline
i conquer claustrophobia

one breath away from mother oceania
your nimble feet make prints in my sands
you have done good for yourselves
since you left my wet embrace
and crawled ashore
every boy is a snake, is a lily
every pearl is a lynx, is a girl
sweet like harmony made into flesh
you dance by my side
children sublime
you show me continents
i see islands
you count the centuries
i blink my eyes
hawks and sparrows race in my waters
stingrays are floating
across the sky
little ones, my sons and my daughters
your sweat is salty
i am why, i am why
i am why
your sweat is salty
i am why, i am why
i am why, i am why

i can't help but get impatient
look no further
look at the sky through
it's dusk now and i'm staring at

here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind

what's the lesser of two evils
if a suicide bomber made to look pregnant
manages to kill her target or not?
what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if she kills them or dies in vain?
nature has fixed no limits on our hopes
oh, what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if her bump was fake or if it was real?
here's my version of it
eternal whirlwind
i have fostered since childhood
well, i don't care
love is all
i dare to drown
to be proven wrong

when your eyes pause on the ball
that hangs on the third branch from the star
you remember why it is dark
and why it gets light again
the earth, like the heart, slopes in its seat
and, like that, it travels along an elliptical path
drawn into the darkness
an unpolished pearl
in sky-black palm of hand
flickering sun-flame
and then you remember
that you, yourself, you are a light-bearer, a light-bearer
receiving radiance from others
flickering sun-flame
unpolished earth in palm of hand

show me forgiveness
for having lost faith in myself
and let my own interior up
to inferior forces
the shame is endless
but if soon start forgiveness
the girl might live

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
i see who you are
i see who you.... are...

it may not always be so
and i say that if your lips
which i have loved
should touch another's
and your dear strong fingers clutch her heart
as mine in time not far away
if on another's face your sweet hair lay
in such a silence as i know
or such great writhing words as, uttering overmuch
stand helplessly before the spirit at bay
if this should be, i say if this should be
you of my heart, send me a little word
that i may go unto her, and take her hands saying
accept all happiness from me
then i shall turn my face
and hear one bird sing terribly afar in the lost lands

when will it be time to document?
do it now!
this submarine behaviour
do it now!
when time?

all of my mouth was kissing him
now, into the air, i am missing him
is this excess texting a blessing?
two music nerds obsessing
he reminds me of the love in me
i'm celebrating on a vibrancy
sending each other mp3s
falling in love to a song
this handsomest of wickermen
he asked if i could wait for him
now, how many lightyears this interim
while i fall in love with his songs?
his hands are good in protecting me
touching and caressing me
but would it be trespassing
wanting him to be blissing me
robbing him of his youth?
cliffhanger like suspension
my longing has formed its own skeleton
bridging the gap between singletons
sending each others these songs
the interior of these melodies
is perhaps where we are meant to be
our physical union a fantasy
i just fell in love with a song
so, i reserve my own intimacies
i bundle them up in packages
my rawward longing far too visceral
did i just fall in love with love?

i'm a fountain of blood
in the shape of a girl
you're the bird on the brim
hypnotised by the whirl
drink me, make me feel real
wet your beak in the stream
game we're playing is life
love's a two way dream
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a path of cinders
burning under your feet
you're the one who walks me
i'm your one way street
i'm a whisper in the water
secret for you to hear
you're the one who grows distant
when i beckon you near
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a tree that grows hearts
one for each that you take
you're the intruder's hand
i'm the branch that you break

my healed chest wound
transformed into a gate
where i receive love from
where i give love from
and i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
split into many parts
splattered light beams into prisms
that will reunite
if you care for me, care for me
if you care for me, care for me
care for me, care for me
and then i'll care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
didn't used to be so needy
just more broken than normal
proud self-sufficiency
my silhouette is oval
it is a gate

i can sense it
something important
is about to happen
it's coming up
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
we just met
and i know i'm a bit too intimate
but something huge is coming up
and we're both included
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
i don't know my future after this weekend
and i don't want to
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality, sensuality

he turned me down, i then downturned another
who then downturned her
the paralyzing juice of rejection
his veins full of lead
he's left with loving what he lost
more than what he has
my snakeskin cold in the dark
but warms up in the light
i then upturned a green eyed giant
who upturned and entered me
will we stop seeing what unites us
but only what differs?
the ghosts of old loves
hovering around his orifices, his orifices...
as you narrate your own hearttale
you thread souls into one beam
the love you gave and have been given
weave into your own dream
i trust my cells to rearchive
my love historic stream

threading

looking hard for
moments of shine
from twilight

i've seen it all, i have seen the trees
i've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
i've seen a man killed by his best friend
and lives that were over before they were spent
i've seen what i was — i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru!
i'm happy to say i had better to do
what about china? have you seen the great wall?
all walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!
and the man you will marry?
the home you will share?

what about china? have you seen the great wall?
all walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!
and the man you will marry?
the home you will share?
to be honest, i really don't care...
you've never been to niagara falls?
i have seen water, it's water, that's all...
the eiffel tower, the empire state?
my pulse was as high on my very first date!
your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?
to be honest, i really don't care...
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you've seen it all and all you have seen
you can always review on your own little screen
the light and the dark, the big and the small
just keep in mind — you need no more at all
you've seen what you were and know what you'll be
you've seen it all — there is no more to see!

i miss you
but i haven't met you yet
so special
but it hasn't happened yet
you are gorgeous
but i haven't met you yet
i remember
but it hasn't happened yet
and if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i will meet you
i was peaking
but it hasn't happened yet
i haven't been given
my best souvenir
i miss you
but i haven't met you yet
i know your habits
but wouldn't recognise you yet
and if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i miss you
i'm so impatient
i can't stand the wait
when will i get my cuddle?
who are you?
i know by now that you'll arrive
by the time i stop waiting
i miss you

well, i've got plenty
you're the one who's missing out
but you won't notice

if you'll live that long
you'll wake up

i dare you

i'm so bored with cowards
that say they want
then they can't handle
you can't handle love

she always knows when people need stroking
and is attracted to deathbeds and divorces
i dreamt she cared for my dying grandfather
lying naked face down on his bed
she insists on total presence
and knows how to get through to the rest of us
she has entered me thousandfold often
and undone knots at my most awkward
music, music loves too
she reaches out to orphans and refugees
embraces them with thermal blankets
her favourite childhood moments
were at a hospital for the disabled
i've seen her offer empathy to widows
she attends funerals of strangers
her strongest memory
is feeding children with leprosy
music heals too
i'm here to defend it

glowed the tiniest spark

in a heart full of dust
lives a creature called lust
it surprises and scares
like me, like me

look at her eyes
dark and sparkling

she sees what everyone sees
and the shadows that crawl in
they crawl in

this mountain top denuded of its features
do they fear me?
all that she said was true

all that she meant was good
all that she meant was good

embraces all

foetus-style

fills you up
nourish, nourish
your turtleheart

don't get angry with yourself
don't, don't get angry with yourself

don't get angry with yourself

i wish to awaken you
to the sounds
of people
rescue them
from themselves
i wish to be totally free
i'm not asking for help

and share some oxygen
to the rescue i'm trying to make sense out of

i have a recurrent dream
every time i lose my voice
i swallow little glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me
during the nights
they do a trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above my bed
while i'm asleep
my mother and son pour into me
warm glowing oil
into my wide open throat
i have a recurrent dream
every time i feel a hoarseness
i swallow warm glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me, oh
they make me feel so much better
they make me feel better
we have a recurrent dream
every time we lose our voices
we dream we swallow little lights
our mother and son bakes for us
during the
====================
i'm a fountain of blood
in the shape of a girl
you're the bird on the brim
hypnotised by the whirl
drink me, make me feel real
wet your beak in the stream
game we're playing is life
love's a two way dream
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a path of cinders
burning under your feet
you're the one who walks me
i'm your one way street
i'm a whisper in the water
secret for you to hear
you're the one who grows distant
when i beckon you near
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a tree that grows hearts
one for each that you take
you're the intruder's hand
i'm the branch that you break

my healed chest wound
transformed into a gate
where i receive love from
where i give love from
and i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
split into many parts
splattered light beams into prisms
that will reunite
if there is one thing i have saved you from
it is fear
and there is no other
and if there is one thing i have saved you from
it is fear
and the fear is a knife that cuts slowly
and the knowledge to master all
and the knowledge to master all
to master all i've got
i've got duct tape around my neck
and a key to my room
i've got toothbrushes in my trunk
i've got toothbrushes in my trunk
i've got toothbrushes in my trunk
and toothbrushes in my trunk
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
split into many parts
splattered light beams into prisms
that will reunite
if there is one thing i have saved you from
it is fear
and the fear is a knife that cuts slowly
and the knowledge to master all
and the knowledge to master all
to master all i've got

i care for you, care for you

can't take her suffer
it's so unfair
the sins of the fathers
they just fucked it all up
we had the best family
we had it all
we had it all in our hands
he just pulled us through the wringer
narcissistic

my throat was stuffed
my mouth was sewn up
banned from making noise
i was not heard
remove this hindrance
my throat feels stuck
i was not allowed
i was not heard
i was not heard
i was not heard
i was not heard
there is vocal sadness
i was separated
from what i can do
what i'm capable of
need to break up
vicious habits
do something i haven't done
i haven't done before
in vow of silence
i explore the negative space
around my mouth
it implodes
black hole
with jaw fallen in
in fallen jaw
jaw fallen in
i am not hurt
i am not hurt
this tunnel has enabled
thousands of sounds
i thank this trunk
noise pipe, noise pipe
i have followed a path
that took sacrifices
now i sacrifice this scar
can you cut it off?

one hand
loves the other
so much on me
born stubborn, me
will always be
before you count "1, 2, 3"
i will have grown my own private branch
of this tree
you, gardener
you, discipliner
domestically
i can obey all of your rules
and still be, be
i never thought i would compromise
i never thought i would compromise
i never thought i would compromise
let's unite tonight
we shouldn't fight
embrace you tight
let's unite tonight
i thrive best
hermit style
with a beard and a pipe
and a parrot on each side
but now i can't do this without you
i never thought i

softly whispers its message to the
lioness who invents her last bark
softly whispers its message to the
aurora who uncovers a path
who heals from all pain

he's cubic, he's cubic
he's a century old
it feels like forever
i wake you up
in the middle of the night
to express my love for you
stroke your skin and feel you
naked i can feel all of you
at the same moment
i wake you up
in the night feeling
this is our last time together
therefore sensing all the moments
we've been together
being here at the same time
every single touch
we ever touch each other
every single fuck
we had together
is in a wondrous time lapse
with us here at this moment
the history of touches
every single archive
compressed into a second
all with us here as i wake you up

your flirts, it finds me out
teases the crack in me
smittens me with hope

possibly maybe
possibly maybe
as much as i definitely enjoy solitude
i wouldn't mind perhaps
spending little time with you
sometimes, sometimes
possibly maybe
probably love possibly maybe

uncertainty excites me, baby
who knows what's going to happen?
lottery or car crash
or you'll join a cult

your eruptions and disasters
i keep calm

i love them!
with you, dozen a day
but after a while i wonder
where's that love you promised me? where is it?
possibly maybe
probably love possibly
possibly, possibly, possibly maybe
probably love possibly
how can you offer me love like that?
my heart's burned
how can you offer me love like that?
i'm exhausted, leave me alone
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
since we broke up
i'm using lipstick again
i suck my tongue
in remembrance of you
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe

through the warmthest cord of care
your love was sent to me
i'm not sure what to do with it
or where to put it
i'm so close to tears
and so close to
simply calling you up
and simply suggesting
we go to that hidden place
that we go to that hidden place
we go to that hidden place
we go to the hidden place
now i have been slightly shy
and i can smell a pinch of hope
to almost have allowed one's fingers
to stroke the fingers i was given to touch with
but careful, careful
there lies my passion, hidden
there lies my love
i'll hide it under a blanket
lull it to sleep
i'll keep it in a hidden place
i'll keep it in a hidden place
keep it in a hidden place
keep it in a hidden place
safe in a hidden place

sunday is gloomy, the hours are slumberless
dearest of shadows i live with are numberless
little white flowers will never awaken you
not where the dark coach of sorrow has taken you
angels have no thought of ever returning you
would they be angry if i thought of joining you?
gloomy sunday
gloomy sunday, with shadows i spend it all
my heart and i have decided to end it all
soon there'll be prayers and candles are lit, i know
let them not weep, let them know that i'm glad to go
death is a dream, for in death i'm caressing you
with the last breath of my soul, i'll be blessing you
gloomy sunday
dreaming
i was only dreaming
i awake and i find you asleep and deep in my heart

darling, i hope that my dream hasn't haunted you
my heart is telling you how much i wanted you

it's absolutely gloomy sunday

i'm not even close
if you ever get close to me
i'm going hunting for mysteries
cover me
i'm going to prove the impossible exists
this is really dangerous
cover me
if you ever get close to me
and i'm bent for earth
cover me
and you will catch a glimpse of what i'm up to
you're down to five
you're on your own
you know that i adore you
you know that i love you
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble

i wake up
and the day feels broken
i tilt my head
i'm trying to get an angle
'cause the evening
i've always longed for
it could still happen
how do i master
the perfect day
six glasses of water
seven phone calls
if you leave it alone
it might just happen
anyway
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
well it never really was
it's not up to you
if you wake up
and the day feels a-broken
just lean into the crack
just lean into the crack
and it will tremble
ever so nicely
notice how it sparkles
down there
i can decide
what i give
but it's not up to me
what i get given
unthinkable surprises
about to happen
but what they are
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
well it never really was
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
oh, me, share
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
oh, it never really was
it's not up to you
well it never really was
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
there's too much
clinging
to peak
there's too much
pressure

she always knows when people need stroking
and is attracted to deathbeds and divorces
i dreamt she cared for my dying grandfather
lying naked face down on his bed
she insists on total presence
and knows how to get through to the rest of us
she has entered me thousandfold often
and undone knots at my most awkward
music, music loves too
she reaches out to orphans and refugees
embraces them with thermal blankets
her favourite childhood moments
were at a hospital for the disabled
i've seen her offer empathy to widows
she attends funerals of strangers
her strongest memory
is feeding children with leprosy
music heals too
i'm here to defend it

there's more to life than this

we could nick a boat
and sneak off to this island
i could bring my little ghettoblaster
there's more to life than this
but we'd have to rush back
to the town's best baker
to get the first bread of the morning

i wake up and find out that i have a heart
it burst into a heart
thunderstorm, come
enter the world
that i belong
there's no-one here
and people everywhere
crying 'cause i need you
crying i can feel you
crying 'cause i need you
crying 'cause i care
it hurts, it heals
the hurt is just another emotional
terror attack
i am strong in his hands
excuse me
but will i go down on my knees?
respect his height
hold him ransom
if you complain once more
you'll be arrested
for your noise
justice
i am strong in his hands
excuse me
but will i go down on my knees?

while i crawl into the unknown
cover me
i'm going hunting for mysteries
cover me
i'm going to prove the impossible exists
this is really dangerous
cover me
but you have to be extremely careful
cover me
i'm going to prove the impossible really exists

there is yet another one
that follows me
wherever i go
and supports me
all this tooth is warmth-like
this tooth is warmth-like
this tooth is warmth-like
and these teeth are a ladder up to his mouth
all these teeth are a ladder that i walk
that you can walk too if you want
if you want up to the mouth
the mouth's cradle
up to the mouth's cradle
he always has a hope for me
always sees me when nothing else
and everyone have left
that ghost is brighter than anyone
and fulfills me with hope
those beams assure me
and you can use these teeth as a ladder
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
and you can follow these notes i'm singing
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
the simplicity of the ghost-like beast
the purity of what it wants and where it goes
always love, always loves you, always loves you
infrared love
and you can use those teeth as a ladder
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
and you can use those teeth, oh, follow my voice
tooth by tooth
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
i need a shelter to build an altar away
from all osamas and bushes
i need a shelter to build an altar away

i once had no fears
none at all
and then when
i had some
to my surprise
i grew to like both
scared or brave
without them
the thrill of fear
thought i'd never admit it
the thrill of fear
now greatly enjoyed with courage
when i once was
untouchable
innocence roared
still amazes
when i once was
innocent
it is still here
but in different places
neurosis
only
attaches
itself to
fertile
ground
where it can flourish
the thrill of fear
thought i'd never admit it
the thrill of fear
now greatly enjoyed with courage
when i once was
fearless
it is again here
but this time
fearless
it is again here
but this time
fearless
it is again here
but this time
fearless
it is again here
but this time
fearless
it is again here
but this time

we are the paratroopers
stampede of fire

i send my greetings to all who have suffered
the courage to share me
to send my greetings to all who have suffered
the courage to share me
to send my greetings to all who have suffered

all of my mouth was kissing him
now, all of my mouth was kissing him
now, all of my mouth was kissing him
now, all of my mouth was kissing him

our romantic gene is dominant
and it hangs limp around his neck
but when you feel it has fallen
i have fallen from your radiance
i have been given to shine on you
and to shine on you
i have been given to shine on you
and to shine on you
i have been given to be able to shine on you
it is a privilege to be able to shine on you
and to be able to shine on you
it is a privilege to be able to shine on you
and to be able to shine on you
it is a luxury to be able to shine on

i'm not stopping
you can't say no to hope
you can't say no to happiness
it will always be there
it will always be there
it's not up to you
it's not up to you

there's too much
clinging

there's too much

she always knows when people need stroking
and is attracted to deathbeds and divorces
i dreamt she cared for my dying grandfather
lying naked face down on his bed
she insists on total presence
and knows how to get through to those around her
she has entered me thousandfold often
and undone knots at my most awkward
music, music loves too
she reaches out to orphans and refugees
embraces them with thermal blankets
her favourite childhood moments
were at a hospital for the disabled
i've seen her offer empathy to widows
she attends funerals of strangers
her strongest memory
is feeding children with leprosy
music heals too
i'm here to defend it

a juxtapositioning fate
find our mutual coordinates
moments of clarity are so rare
i better document this
at last the view is fierce
all that matters is
who is open chested
and who has coagulated
who can share and
who has shut down the chances?
show me emotional respect, oh respect, oh respect
and i have emotional needs, oh needs, oh ooh
i wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, oh ooh
what is it that i have
that makes me feel your pain?
like milking a stone
to get you to say it
who is open?
and who has shut up
and if one feels closed
how does one stay open?
we have emotional needs, oh needs, oh needs, oh ooh
i wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, ooh

we live on a mountain
right at the top
there's a beautiful view
from the top of the mountain
every morning i walk towards the edge
and throw little things off
like car parts, bottles and cutlery
or whatever i find lying around
it's become a habit
a way to start the day
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
it's early morning
no one is awake
i'm back at my cliff
still throwing things off
i listen to the sounds they make
on their way down
i follow with my eyes till they crash
i imagine what my body would sound like
slamming against those rocks
and when it lands
will my eyes be closed or open?
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this

and all is fired with love

and the universe is laughing at last

and i don't want to hear it

i find myself out gazing at stars
hearing guitars
like someone in love
sometimes the things i do astound me
mostly whenever you're around me
lately
i seem to walk as though i have wings
bump into things
like someone in love
each time i look at you, i'm limp as a glove
and feeling like someone in love

listen how they grow
i'm blinded by the lights
listen how they grow
in the core of the earth
listen how they glow
crystalline
internal nebula
crystalline
rocks growing slow-mo
crystalline
i conquer claustrophobia
crystalline
and demand the light
we mimic the openness
of the ones we love
dovetail our generosity
equalize the flow
with our hearts
we chisel quartz
to reach love
crystalline
internal nebula
crystalline
rocks growing slow-mo
crystalline
i conquer claustrophobia
crystalline
and demand the light
octagon, polygon
pipes up an organ
sonic branches
murmuring drone
crystallizing galaxies
spread out like my fingers

fireworks are burning

genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
so warm
sounds go through the muscles
these abstract, wordless movements
move, move, move, move, move
they start off cells that haven't been touched before
these cells are virgins
waking up slowly waking up
waking up slowly wake up
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
nothing will be the same
i'm asleep
i'm fast asleep
i like this resonance
it elevates me
i don't recognise myself
this is very interesting
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
i'm fast asleep now
you're still with me
i'm fast asleep
i'm asleep
my headphones
they saved, saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

i shuffle around the tectonic plates in my chest
you know i gave it all
try to match our continents
to change seasonal shift
to form a mutual core
as fast as your fingernail grows
the atlantic ridge drifts
to counteract distance
you know i gave it all
can you hear the effort
of the magnetic strife?
shuffling of columns
to form a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
you hid the key to our continuity
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know
what you resist persists
nuance makes heat
to counteract distance
i know you gave it all
offered me harmony
if things were done your way
my eurasian plate subsumed
forming a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know i had it in me
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know



his embrace, a fortress
it fuels me and places
a skeleton of trust
right beneath us
bone by bone
stone by stone
if you ask yourself patiently and carefully:
who is it? who is it?
who is it that never lets you down?
who is it that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are, they're going around
now they're handing it over
they're handing it over, handing it over
who is it that never lets you down?
who is it that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are, they're going around
now they're handing it over
handing it over
handing it over...
he demands a closeness
we all have earned a lightness
carry my joy on the left
carry my pain on the right
if you ask yourself now, patiently and carefully:
who is it?
who is it that never lets you down?
who is it that gave you back your crown?

lately
i've been exploring different bodies
experiencing the unknown
learning from our mistakes
learning from our failures
learning from our mistakes
learning from our mistakes
we've all been through it
it's a little bit overwhelming
but when you get through it
the things i have
like this in my heart
every single love
i look at
your nails
and those of my children
and those of my wife
and those of my children
i don't know me
forgetting about you
having this big heart
swirling in my grave
crystallizing all of my mess
and then i'd return it
crystallizing all of my mess
and then i'd return it
crystallizing all of my mess
and then i'd return it
crystallizing all of my mess
what's the lesser of two evils
if a suicide bomber made to look pregnant
manages to kill her target or not?
what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if she kills them or dies in vain?
nature has fixed no limits on our hopes
oh, what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if her bump was fake or if it was real?
here's my version of it
eternal whirlwind
i have fostered since childhood
well, i don't care
love is all
i dare to drown
to be proven wrong

when your eyes pause on the ball
that hangs on the third branch from the star
you remember why it is dark
and why it gets light again
the earth, like the heart, slopes in its seat
and, like that, it travels along an elliptical path
drawn into the darkness
an unpolished pearl
in sky-black palm of hand
flickering sun-flame
and then you remember
that you, yourself, you are a light-bearer, a light-bearer
receiving radiance from others
flickering sun-flame
unpolished earth in palm of hand

show me forgiveness
for having lost faith in myself
and let my own interior up
to inferior forces
the shame is endless
but if soon start forgiveness
the girl might live

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
i see who you are
i see who you.... are...

it may not always be so
and i say that if your lips
which i have loved
should touch another's
and your dear strong fingers clutch her heart
as mine in time not far away
if on another's face your sweet hair lay
in such a silence as i know
or such great writhing words as, uttering overmuch
stand
====================
and now i wake up
and the day feels a-broken
just lean into the crack
just lean into the crack
and it will tremble
ever so nicely
notice how it sparkles
down there
i can decide
what i give
but it's not up to me
what i get given
unthinkable surprises
about to happen
but what they are
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
well it never really was
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
oh, me, share
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
oh, it never really was
it's not up to you
well it never really was
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
there's too much
clinging
to peak
there's too much
pressure

she always knows when people need stroking
and is attracted to deathbeds and divorces
i dreamt she cared for my dying grandfather
lying naked face down on his bed
she insists on total presence
and knows how to get through to the rest of us
she has entered me thousandfold often
and undone knots at my most awkward
music, music loves too
she reaches out to orphans and refugees
embraces them with thermal blankets
her favourite childhood moments
were at a hospital for the disabled
i've seen her offer empathy to widows
she attends funerals of strangers
her strongest memory
is feeding children with leprosy
music heals too
i'm here to defend it

i'm drowned in your currents
you're the ocean
looking after me

while i'm gone
listen to the music of the whales
fear is a powerful drug
overcome it and
you think that you can do
anything
should i
save myself
for later
or generously give?
fear of
losing face
is draining
it locks up your being
and forces you to sacrifice
it makes me feel smaller
notice how much i crave privacy
nothing will be the same
when i get older
and you say: "look at me, sharp-shooter!'"
i'll be humble butler
and you, me, subtler
you made my dream come true
i'm so bored of cowards
who say they want to share
then they often do
it's become a habit
to cut corners and not get stingy
i know it's not easy to accept
the world is big and ugly
but don't get angry with yourself

my name isobel
married to myself
but we're opposite beds
we're opposite continents
we're opposite continents
reading a pornographic movie
in the distance heat
hollow
i'm still inside
but this is my last time here
this is my last time here
i'm going to this island
to explore
this is my last time here
this is my last time here
this is my last time here

everything is waiting for you

there's nothing wrong
everything is waiting for you

====================
we all were made to feel
it was then
it would be
it would be
it would be
it would be
the triumph of a heart
forging miracles
with a tongue
to express my love for you
oh, you
oh, you
you

while i crawl into the unknown
cover me
i'm going hunting for mysteries
cover me
i'm going to prove the impossible exists
this is really dangerous
cover me
but worth all the effort
cover me
i'm going to prove the impossible really exists

there is yet another one
that follows me
wherever i go
and supports me
all this tooth is warmth-like
this tooth is warmth-like
this tooth is warmth-like
and these teeth are a ladder up to his mouth
all these teeth are a ladder that i walk
that you can walk too if you want
if you want up to the mouth
the mouth's cradle
up to the mouth's cradle
he always has a hope for me
always sees me when nothing else
and everyone have left
that ghost is brighter than anyone
and fulfills me with hope
those beams assure me
and you can use these teeth as a ladder
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
and you can follow these notes i'm singing
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
the simplicity of the ghost-like beast
the purity of what it wants and where it goes
always love, always loves you, always loves you
infrared love
and you can use those teeth as a ladder
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
and you can use those teeth, oh, follow my voice
tooth by tooth
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle

i once had no fears
none at all
and then when
i had some
to my surprise
i grew to like both
scared or brave
without them
the thrill of fear
thought i'd never admit it
the thrill of fear
now greatly enjoyed with courage
when i once was
untouchable
innocence roared
still amazes
when i once was
innocent
it is still here
but in different places
neurosis
only
attaches
itself to
fertile
ground
where it can flourish
the thrill of fear
thought i'd never admit it
the thrill of fear
now greatly enjoyed with courage
when i once was
fearless
innocence roared
still amazes
untouchable
innocence
it is still here
but in different places

it locks up your chest
shuts down the heart
miserly

you can't get no
thank you
you, thank you
you, thank you
you're the strongest
you've ever been

my palms are so warm
cold sweat is falling
down my neck
asking for forgiveness
asking for forgiveness
but there's no forgiveness, there's no forgiveness
we've seen it all, we've seen the same guy
but there's more to life than this
weezing and turning on the lights
all this broken glass
all that is right and is wrong
is where we are meant to be
our home is on fire
it is important that you take care of it
carefully
and evenly
so that you not burn into anyone
the world will see
and all will laugh at the same moment
you're all i ever wanted
you're all i ever wanted
you're all i ever wanted
you're all i ever wanted
you're all i ever wanted
you're all i ever wanted

spread his legs
spread your legs
in a secluded spot
in the heart of the city
right opposite the hurricane
no one wants to know about him
and they point where he goes
he still holds out alone
a camera pans the location
behind a blind of potted palms
and finds a handwritten note
from a secret lover
my heart is heavy on something
it's not my place to tell it to
unnecessarily heavy on something
it's not my place to tell it to
it's not my place to tell it to
you can't say no to hope
it doesn't frighten me
it doesn't scare me at all
you can't say no to happiness
it doesn't frighten me
it doesn't scare me
it's not my place to tell it to
unnecessarily heavy on something
it's not my place to tell it to
it's not my place to tell it to
it's not my place to tell it to
it would scare me, it's not my place to tell
it wouldn't fright

when i spot someone who is same height as you
and goes to same record stores
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
when i hear someone with same accent as yours
asking directions with the same beard as yours
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
isn't it odd?
isn't it peculiar?
these statistics of my mind
shuffling your features
assembling a man
googling love
warming my heart on this log fire of love
features creatures
features creatures
features creatures
features creatures
his orifices
his orifices

i can sense it
something important
is about to happen
it's coming up
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
we just met
and i know i'm a bit too intimate
but something huge is coming up
and we're both included
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
i don't know my future after this weekend
and i don't want to
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality, sensuality

he turned me down, i then downturned another
who then downturned her
the paralyzing juice of rejection
his veins full of lead
he's left with loving what he lost
more than what he has
my snakeskin cold in the dark
but warms up in the light
i then upturned a green eyed giant
who upturned and entered me
will we stop seeing what unites us
but only what differs?
the ghosts of old loves
hovering around his orifices, his orifices...
as you narrate your own hearttale
you thread souls into one beam
the love you gave and have been given
weave into your own dream
i trust my cells to rearchive
my love historic stream

threading
the glacier head
looking hard for
moments of shine
from twilight
to twilight
aurora

shoot me
beyond this suffer
the need

i've seen it all, i have seen the trees
i've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
i've seen a man killed by his best friend
and lives that were over before they were spent
i've seen what i was — i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru!
i'm happy to say i had better to do
what about china? have you seen the great wall?
all walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!

====================
i have lost count
how many dresses were on the table
and the stars were already lit
and the minutes were up
i'm not stopping
you can't say no to hope
you can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
and if you say no to happiness
i'll take your money
run for it
run for your boy
fear of nothing, don't get angry with me
i'll catch you
fear of nothing, don't get angry with me
i'll catch you
fear of nothing, don't get angry with me
i'll catch you
fear of nothing, don't get angry with me
i'll catch you
i'll catch you
i'll catch you
you couldn't say no to hope
you could only dream
a dream made of stars
a star was made of steel
and when i wake you up
the second time
i feel you're again
you can't say no to hope
you could only dream
a dream made of stars
a star was made of steel
and when i wake you up
the second time
i remember

bærinn minn
bærinn minn og þinn

grasið mitt og þitt
geymir mold til vors
hjúfrar lind
leynt við brekkurót
vakir eins og við
lífi trútt
kyrrlátt kalda vermsl

brosa við mér björt

i have a recurrent dream
every time i lose my voice
i swallow little glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me
during the nights
they do a trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above my bed
while i'm asleep
my mother and son pour into me
warm
====================
and i find out the hard way
you can't say no to hope
you can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
i'm no fucking buddhist
but this is enlightenment
the less room you give me
the more space i've got
it doesn't scare me at all
you can't say no to hope
you can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all

i wish i want to stay here
i wish this be enough
i wish i only love you
i wish simplicity
look at the speed out there
it magnetizes me to it
and i have no fear
i'm only into this to
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
i wish i'd only look
and didn't have to touch
i wish i'd only smell this
and didn't have to taste
how can i ignore?
this is sex without touching
i'm going to explore
i'm only into this to
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy

i will wade out till my thighs
are steeped in burning flowers
i will take the sun in my mouth
and leap into the ripe air alive
with closed eyes
to dash against darkness
in the sleeping curves of my body
i shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
with chasteness of seagirls
will i complete the mystery of my flesh?
will i complete the mystery of my flesh, my flesh?

i walk through this land
stake a claim
with my sense
with my bark
mark my nest with song
hear the, the echo, echo from that cliff
i draw laser line through lake
to take physicality
i inhale this physicality
this forest is in me
this forest is in me
i immerse me
this is my home
this is, this is my home

if there is a troubador washing: it is he
if there is a man about town: it is he
if there is one to be sought: it is he
if there are nine she's: they are bought for me
this way is as is she
and he placed her unclothed, long, long, long-legged
on top of the family tree
and if he has chosen the point while she is under him
then leave her coily placed crouched sucking him
for it is i
with her on knee
i leave her without pith or feel
and leave her be
leave it be, for he controls what there'll be
he makes his face known to none
for if he is seen, then all will
and all will know
know me

excuse me
but i just have to
explode
explode this body
off me
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
i'll be brand new
brand new tomorrow
a little bit tired
but brand new
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
oaaahh!!!

oh, oh
darling, stop confusing me
with your wishful thinking
hopeful embraces
don't you understand?
i have to go through this
i belong to here where
no one cares, and no one loves
no light no air to live in
a place called hate
the city of fear
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
and the hurt stops
it's sometimes just like sleeping
curling up inside my private tortures
i nestle into pain
hug suffering
caress every ache
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting

like a virus needs a body
as soft tissue feeds on blood
some day i'll find you, the urge is here
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
like a mushroom on a tree trunk
as the protein transmutates
i knock on your skin, and i am in
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
the perfect match, you and me
i adapt, contagious
====================
it's wet in the ground
i'm lying face down on my bed
sue me, sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
i won't let you denounce our origin
sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
denounce our origin, no, sue me
denounce our origin, no, sue me
i won't let you denounce our origin
sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
denounce our origin, no, sue me

i'll nurse you
you know that i adore you
you know that i love you
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm
come to me

how could i be so immature

====================
my headphones
my purse
i'm naked and laughing
off to this day
i feel wronged by
the light drizzle
and the dark embrace
drawn into place
a closed loop
a bosom of sensations
i kiss the air
around the clock
music heals
i fall in love
this time it's rain

don't pull me down to your rescue
don't pull me down to your rescue
don't pull me down to your rescue
i don't want you here
i don't want you here
i don't want you here
anymore
don't pull me down to your rescue
don't pull me down to your rescue
don't pull me down to your rescue
don't pull me down to your rescue

i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is where i'm staying
this is my home
i live by the ocean

i dive into it

one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it will all come true
one day
when you're ready
one day, one day
when you're up to it
the atmosphere
will get lighter
and two suns ready
to shine just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it will all make sense
one day
you will blossom
one day, one day
when you're ready
an aeroplane
will curve gracefully
around the volcano
with the eruption that never lets you down
i can feel it
i can feel it
and the beautifullest
fireworks are burning
in the sky, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh
just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
it will all come true
one day
one day, one day

genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
so warm
sounds go through the muscles
these abstract, wordless movements
move, move, move, move, move
they start off cells that haven't been touched before
these cells are virgins
waking up slowly waking up
waking up slowly wake up
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
nothing will be the same
i'm asleep
i'm fast asleep
i like this resonance
it elevates me
i don't recognise myself
this is very interesting
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
i'm fast asleep now
you're still with me
i'm fast asleep
i'm asleep
my headphones
they saved, saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

i shuffle around the tectonic plates in my chest
you know i gave it all
try to match our continents
to change seasonal shift
to form a mutual core
as fast as your fingernail grows
the atlantic ridge drifts
to counteract distance
you know i gave it all
can you hear the effort
of the magnetic strife?
shuffling of columns
to form a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
you hid the key to our continuity
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know
what you resist persists
nuance makes heat
to counteract distance
i know you gave it all
offered me harmony
if things were done your way
my eurasian plate subsumed
forming a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know i had it in me
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know



his embrace, a fortress
it fuels me and places
a skeleton of trust
right beneath us
bone by bone
stone by stone
if you

it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
oh i
it's not meant to be a strife to conquer
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
oh i
it's not meant to be a strife to conquer
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
undo
undo
if you're bleeding
undo
and if you're sweating
undo
if you're crying, darling
undo
undo
oh i
unravel

when i spot someone who is same height as you
and goes to same record stores
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
when i hear someone with same accent as yours
asking directions with the same beard as yours
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
isn't it odd?
isn't it peculiar?
these statistics of my mind
shuffling your features
assembling a man
googling love
warming my heart on this log fire of love
features creatures
features creatures
features creatures
features creatures
his orifices
his orifices

i can sense it
something important
is about to happen
it's coming up
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
we just met
and i know i'm a bit too intimate
but something huge is coming up
and we're both included
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
i don't know my future after this weekend
and i don't want to
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality, sensuality

he turned me down, i then downturned another
who then downturned her
the paralyzing juice of rejection
his veins full of lead
he's left with loving what he lost
more than what he has
my snakeskin cold in the dark
but warms up in the light
i then upturned a green eyed giant
who upturned and entered me
will we stop seeing what unites us
but only what differs?
the ghosts of old loves
hovering around his orifices, his orifices...
as you narrate your own hearttale
you thread souls into one beam
the love you gave and have been given
weave into your own dream
i trust my cells to rearchive
my love historic stream

threading
the glacier head
looking hard for
moments of shine
from twilight
to twilight
aurora
ahh-ahh
uhh-uhh
ahh-uhh
aurora
goddess sparkle
shoot me
beyond this suffer
the need
is great
aurora
ahh-ahh
uhh-uhh
ahh-uhh
aurora
goddess sparkle
a mountain shade
suggests your shape
i tumbled down
on my knees
fill the mouth
with snow
the way it melts
i wish
to melt
into you
aurora
ahh-ahh
uhh-uhh
ahh-uhh
spark the sun off
spark the sun off
spark the sun off
spark the sun off for me

i've seen it all, i have seen the trees
i've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
i've seen a man killed by his best friend
and lives that were over before they were spent
i've seen what i was — i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru!
i'm happy to say i had better to do
what about china? have you seen the great wall?
all walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!
and the man you will marry?
the home you will share?
to be honest, i really don't care...
you've never been to niagara falls?
i have seen water, it's water, that's all...
the eiffel tower, the empire state?
my pulse was as high on my very first date!
your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?
to be honest, i really don't care...
i've seen it all, i've seen the dark
i've seen the brightness in one little spark
i've seen what i chose and i've seen what i need
and that is enough, to want more would be greed
i've seen what i was and i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you've seen it all and all you have seen
you can always review on your own little
====================
the old man you know
he is strong in his arms
he invents a charm that unites us
we have been together for a thousand years
and if one man sees what's inside of me
and one day we'll be together
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
it will all come true
one day
one day, one day

if you ask yourself patiently and carefully:
who is it? who is it?
who is it that never lets you down?
who is it that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are, they're going around
now they're handing it over
they're handing it over, handing it over
who is it that never lets you down?
who is it that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are, they're going around
now they're handing it over
handing it over

we all have earned a lightness
carry my joy on the left
carry my pain on the right
if you ask yourself now, patiently and carefully:

who is it that never lets you down?
who is it that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are, they're going around
and they're handing it over
handing it over, handing
who is it that never lets you down?

since i met you
this small town hasn't got room
for my big feelings
violently happy
cause i love you
violently happy
but you're not here
violently happy
come calm me down
before i get into trouble
i tip-toe down to the shore
stand by the ocean
make it roar at me
and i roar back
violently happy
cause i love you
violently happy
but you're not here
violently happy
overemotional
violently happy
i'll get into trouble
real soon
if you don't get here
baby


====================
show me forgiveness
for having lost faith in myself
and let my own interior up
to inferior forces
the shame is endless
but if soon start forgiveness
the girl might live

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
and enjoy every bit of you
of you
i see who you are
i see who you... are...

we live on a mountain
right at the top
there's a beautiful view
from the top of themountain
everymorning i walktowards the edge
and throw little thingsoff
like car parts, bottles and cutlery
or whatever i find lying around
it's become a habit
a way to start the day
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
it's real early morning
no one is awake
i'm back at my cliff
still throwing things off
i listen to sounds they make
on their way down
i follow with my eyes till they crash
i imagine what my body would sound like
slamming against those rocks
and when it lands
will my eyes be closed or open?
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you

all these accidents that happen
follow the dot
coincidence makes sense
only with you
you don't have to speak
i feel
emotional landscapes
they puzzle me
the riddle gets solved
and you push me up to
this state of emergency
how can i lead you astray?
this is an emotional rollercoaster
the heart is big and the mind is small
but you don't have to speak
i feel
emotional landscapes
they puzzle me
confuse
can the riddle get solved?
and you push me up to
this state of emergency
how can i lead you astray?
this is an emotional rollercoaster
the heart is big and the mind is small
but you don't have to speak
i feel

i'm a fountain of blood
in the shape of a girl
you're the bird on the brim
hypnotised by the whirl
drink me, make me feel real
wet your beak in the stream
game we're playing is life
love's a two way dream
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a path of cinders
burning under your feet
you're the one who walks me
i'm your one way street
i'm a whisper in the water
secret for you to hear
you're the one who grows distant
when i beckon you near
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a tree that grows hearts
one for each that you take
you're the intruder's hand
i'm the branch that you break

my healed chest wound
transformed into a gate
where i receive love from
where i give love from
and i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
split into many parts
splattered light beams into prisms
that will reunite
if you care for me, care for me
if you care for me, care for me
care for me, care for me
and then i
====================
i'm so broken
heðan-liður-afte-care
please release this pressure of me
i'm so broken
heðan-liður-afte-care
please release this pressure of me
and then i'll stop trying to make sense of it all
please release this pressure of me
let off some steam

here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind
here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind
here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind
what's the lesser of two evils
if a suicide bomber made to look pregnant
manages to kill her target or not?
what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if she kills them or dies in vain?
nature has fixed no limits on our hopes
oh, what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if her bump was fake or if it was real?
here's my version of it
eternal whirlwind
i have fostered since childhood
well, i don't care
love is all
i dare to drown
to be proven wrong

when your eyes pause on the ball
that hangs on the third branch from the star
you remember why it is dark
and why it gets light again
the earth, like the heart, slopes in its seat
and, like that, it travels along an elliptical path
drawn into the darkness
an unpolished pearl
in sky-black palm of hand
flickering sun-flame
and then you remember
that you, yourself, you are a light-bearer, a light-bearer
receiving radiance from others
flickering sun-flame
unpolished earth in palm of hand

show me forgiveness
for having lost faith in myself
and let my own interior up
to inferior forces
the shame is endless
but if soon start forgiveness
the girl might live

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now

let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly

i see who you are
i see who you.... are...

it may not always be so
and i say that if your lips
which i have loved
should touch another's
and your dear strong fingers clutch her heart
as mine in time not far away
if on another's face your sweet hair lay
in such a silence as i know
or such great writhing words as, uttering overmuch
stand helplessly before the spirit at bay
if this should be, i say if this should be
you of my heart, send me a little word
that i may go unto her, and take her hands saying
accept all happiness from me
then i shall turn my face
and hear one bird sing terribly afar in the lost lands

when will it be time to document?
do it now!
this submarine behaviour
do it now!
when time?
do it now!
to return
do it now!
do it now!
shake us out of the heavy deep sleep
shake us now!
do it now!
do it now!
shake us out of the heavy deep sleep
do it now!
