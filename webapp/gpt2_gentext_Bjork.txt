the ground is opening up
swallows me up
the trunk of dna
the trunk of dna, trunk
now come forth, all species
hollow
like a bead in necklace
thread me upon this chain
i'm part of it, ohh
the everlasting necklace
jewels after jewels after jewels after
jewels after jewels after jewels
i yearn to belong
let me belong
let me belong

up on the toe
there is a view
up on the toe
and the spine
straight and erect
hungry and curious
up on the toe
looking forward to
the air is thinner here
she came here
to lose face
got down on her knees
the beast is back!
on four legs
set her clock to the moon
raises her spine
vertebrae by vertebrae
up on the toe
looking
i have been filled with steam for months, for years
same old cloud, claustrophobic me
let it burst like old train sounds
make them leave me nature
vertebrae by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
my arms ooze out of my shoulders!
and the arms ooze out of my shoulders
i curl my tail inwards, inwards
i set my clock on the moon
vertebrae by vertebrae
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
let off the pressure
the earth is opening up
swallows me up
the trunk of dna
the trunk of dna, trunk
now come forth, all species
hollow
like a bead in necklace
thread me upon this chain

the lukewarm
liberates
the girl
when she awakens
the night is falling
the clouds have fallen
the sun is gone mad
and ahead of you
the little girl you promised
has come back
and shown me her love
we are the once proud earth dwellers
now we are the once proud earth dwellers
you have abandoned her womb
and gone mad
the atmosphere is turning me down
you have fallen into a pit
you have abandoned your home
and gone mad
the earth is turning me down
you have fallen into a pit
you have abandoned your home
now we are the once proud earth dwellers
you are the intruder
you have abandoned your instinct
so strong
but if you leave me now
and stay here
i will devour you whole
and leave you feeling abandoned
i have abandoned you
i will leave you feeling abandoned
i have abandoned you
i want to go back to
the days of your song
the great silence
is the silence that i give
every time i go away
i cherish it
as a remembrance
i give it weight
on my arms i carry a message
that i will always remember
if you forget me
i will go away
doing what i love
i give you space
i'll never return it
so special
but if you forget me
i will go away
doing what i love
i give you space
i'll never return it
i want to go away
doing what i love

all that i ever wanted
was given to you
and if you ever want it
i'll always remember
if you ever want it
i'll always remember
if you ever want it
i'll always remember
i just wanted to give you
all that i ever wanted
was given to you
and if you ever want it
i'll always remember
if you ever want it
i'll always remember
if you ever want it
i'll always remember

i can't get no love

when i'm drivin' in my car
and the man comes on the radio
he's tellin' me more and more
about some useless information
designed to
fire my imagination
i can't get no
no, no, no
hey, hey, hey
that's what i say
i can't get no
i can't get no
that's what i say
i can't get no
get over it
'cause when i grow up
i'm gonna get those fancy keyrings
that say, "HI-HI, HUH-HI-HI-HI!"
and they'll come on foot
oh, they say the dress code
is followed by the excitement
that's what i'm made of
i can't get no
i can't get no
i can't get no

it's slippery down to the roots

real deal

i wish to happen slowly
before you catch me
real soon

it would burst the bubble
break the charm
jump off
your building's on fire
and i'll catch you
i'll catch you
destroy all that is keeping you down
and then i'll nurse you
i'll nurse you
you'll be immortal
i'll keep you safe from death
i'll keep you safe from death
you'll be immortal
i'll keep you safe from death
immortal
but worth all the effort
to get where you are
it would be a tragedy if she went astray
erroneously
why do i love her so much?
what is to love?
how do i reach the top?

i'm a fountain of blood
in the shape of a girl
you're the boy
i'm dancing with you
go around the city
swimming with you
you're the water, the shy boy
crystallizing me
you're the boy

why?
to get water for your family
kids, for your love
why?

oh my!
it's snowing-don't-miss-it-now
i'm so bored
it's time to get creative
there is no ending
i'm at the peak of my swing
and if i lose my temper
i can't get out of this
it's not over before they
i'm queen of
the sunset is gone
and the man in the ball - he just keeps on going
faster than a shooting star!
and if one day i find him
and he shows me his webbed fingers
i can't get no
it's not over before they - if one day i find him
and he rears him high
and he transmogrifies us into a people
it's not over before they get to know us
if one day i find him
and he rears him high
and he transmogs us into a people
it's not over before they get to know us
if one day i find him
and he rears him high
and he transmogs us into a people
it's not over before they get to know us
if one day i find him
and he rears him high
and he transmogs us into a people

his big toe is missing
and the man in the ball
if that is the end of it
then one day i will find him
and he will send me strong signals
that i shall take back
this is not a fight bout
you have to manage
i won't let you anger me
touch me or else
i'll get into trouble
realising
i won't let you anger me get in the way
i won't let you anger me get in the way
i won't let you anger me into youtaking back
this is not a fight bout
you have to manage
i won't let you anger me
i won't let you anger me
i won't let you angry me into me
then one day, two days
i will hunt for predators
predators which i can't find
and get as many as i can from my hiding place
then, on that day
i will return fire
with lumps of bark
or human teeth
or human saliva
or either of them
i won't let you anger me
i won't let you anger me get in the way
i won't let you anger me into you
let's unite tonight

all that she said was true
all that she said was true
her voice was strong
she said it clearly
she was still
after all that she had
to do
what was necessary
was over
and gone
as expected
from the start
i was determined
to create a flow
not endless
i set my sights high
and let them take over
all that they find
i is at bay
i can't open up
it will make it hard for you
you can't see the tears in my eyes
i know that you will
come out of me

look no further
look no further
look no further
i see the tears in my eyes
i see the darkness that i have
passionately sought to rid myself of
i drain that poison
destroy all that exists
to give you the sparkle you need
you're the intruder
you are the intruder
you are the intruder
you are the intruder
i see the tears in my eyes
i see the corruption in him
i see the tears in my eyes
i see the tears in my eyes
i see the tears in my eyes
it's not easy
it's not easy
to let go
and not get too attached
it's not easy
to get attached
and not get too attached
it's not easy
it's not easy
to get attached
and not get too attached
it's not easy
it's not easy
it's not easy
it's not easy

a tear in my eye
look no further
look no further
i see the tears
in the eyes of my people
declare independence!
let them rule!
they're the ones who say no!
let them go!
they're the ones who say no!
they're the ones who say no!
our people have to get used to it
it's real bad news: you've got to get used to it
the lights are up, the cars are roaring!
it's real bad news: you've got to get used to it
the people are roaring!
they're the ones who say no!
how can you lose?
the world is always on fire
i wake up
the streets are always full of love
i azalea d'oro
bump into the meadow
um, um, mare's supper
um, um, um, um, um, um

dull sparkling light
gloomy sunday
cabin by cabin
shot me a lightning-bolt
so i can't forget
i've seen it all, i have seen the trees
i've seen the willow-leaf trimmings
gloomy sunday
i've seen the lukewarm glow
of a volcano
none of this has to be said
i've seen what i was and i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru!
i'm happy to say i had better to do
what about china? have you seen the great wall?
all walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!
and the man you will marry?
the home you will share?
to be honest, i really don't care...
you've never been to niagara falls?
i have seen water, it's water, that's all...
the eiffel tower, the empire state?
my pulse was as high on my very first date!
your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?
to be honest, i really don't care...
i've seen it all, i've seen the dark
i've seen the brightness in one little spark
i've seen what i chose and i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you've seen it all and all you have seen
you can always review on your own little screen
the light and the dark, the big and the small
just keep in mind — you need no more at all
you've seen what you were and know what you'll be
you've seen it all — there is no more to see!

i miss you
but i haven't met you yet
so special
but it hasn't happened yet
you are gorgeous
but i haven't met you yet
i remember
but it hasn't happened yet
and if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i will meet you
i was peaking
but it hasn't happened yet
i haven't been given
my best souvenir
i miss you
but i haven't met you yet
i know your habits
but wouldn't recognise you yet
and if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i miss you
i'm so impatient
i can't stand the wait
when will i get my cuddle?
who are you?
i know by now that you'll arrive
by the time i stop waiting
i miss you

all the modern things
like cars and such
have always existed
they've just been waiting in a mountain
for the right moment
listening to the irritating noises
of dinosaurs and people
dabbling outside
engin fylgist alveg

engin sér við mér
það er sól þegar
andar inn í mér
hann bítur mig
hann bítur mig
já, hann kemur með

you think you're denying me of something
well, i've got plenty
you're the one who's missing out
but you won't notice
until after five years
if you'll live that long
you'll wake up
all loveless
i dare you
to take me on
i dare you
to show me your palms
i'm so bored with cowards
that say they want
then they can't handle
you can't handle love
you can't handle love
you just can't handle
i dare you
to take me on
i dare you
to show me your palms
what's so scary?
not a threat in sight
you just can't handle
you can't handle love
you can't handle love
baby, you can't handle love
it's obvious
you can't handle
i dare you
to take me on

lives a creature called lust
it surprises and scares

crawling in silence, a simple excuse
in a tower of steel
nature forges a deal
to raise wonderful hell

arousal
once you fell out of love
did i love you too
too bad now
not today, never mind
nothing will be the same
i'm alone and i don't know what to do with my life
i know i'm brave
this is an alarm-call
so wake up, wake up now
today has never happened
and it doesn't frighten me
it doesn't scare me at all
you can't say no to hope
you can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all

i wish i want to stay here
i wish this be enough
i wish i only love you
i wish simplicity
look at the speed out there
it magnetizes me to it
and i have no fear
i'm only into this to
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
i wish i'd only look
and didn't have to touch
i wish i'd only smell this
and didn't have to taste
how can i ignore?
this is sex without touching
i'm going to explore
i'm only into this to
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy

i will wade out till my thighs
are steeped in burning flowers
i will take the sun in my mouth
and leap into the ripe air alive
with closed eyes
to dash against darkness
in the sleeping curves of my body
i shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
with chasteness of seagrave
will i complete the mystery of my flesh?
will i complete the mystery of my flesh, my flesh?

i walk through this land
stake a claim
with my sense
with my bark
mark my nest with song
hear the, the echo, echo from that cliff
i draw laser line through lake
to take physicality
i inhale this physicality
this forest is in me
this forest is in me
i immerse me
this is my home
this is, this is my home

if there is a troubador washing: it is he
if there is a man about town: it is he
if there is one to be sought: it is he
if there are nine she's: they are bought for me
this way is as is she
and he placed her unclothed, long, long, long-legged
on top of the family tree
and if he has chosen the point while she is under him
then leave her coily placed crouched sucking him
for it is i
with her on knee
i leave her without pith or feel
and leave her be
leave it be, for he controls what there'll be
he makes his face known to none
for if he is seen, then all will
and all will know
know me

excuse me
but i just have to
explode
explode this body
off me
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
i'll be brand new
brand new tomorrow
a little bit tired
but brand new
oooooh
oooooh

ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!

ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
oaaahh!!!

oh, oh
darling, stop confusing me
with your wishful thinking
hopeful embraces
don't you understand?
i have to go through this
i belong to here where
no one cares, and no one loves
no light no air to live in
a place called hate
the city of fear
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
and the hurt stops
it's sometimes just like that
like someone in love
when they fall in love
you always say the word 'no' often
and that seems to be what i do
every time i feel the urge to smack a tree
i shuffle my feet as if they were guests
i turn around and see someone
different
sometimes people get along so well
you can't ignore the chance
you know there's someone like you
who you are
and wants to know about
how i made it to this point
without you i wouldn't have been born
now i'm small
but you're the strongest thing
since sliced bread
and i have to use it up
you know there's someone like me
who you are

====================
i'm a fountain of blood
let's finish this inn

crying 'cause i care
it's a hot day and i'm dressed lightly
i move carefully through the crowd
here everyone is so vulnerable
and i'm as well
there's no-one here

crying 'cause i need you
crying i can feel you

one of these days, soon, very soon
love you 'til then, love you 'til then

come on, girl
let's sneak out of this party
it's getting boring
there's more to life than this
it's still early morning
we could go down to the harbor
and jump between the boats
and see the sun come up
you know that there's more to life than this?
you know that there's more to life?
you know that there's more to life than this?
you know that there's more to life?

====================
the soft, salty air
she whispers in my ear
your mission was met
and if you're going to compromise
you have to get through to the people
what kind of girl wants to go out?
what kind of music is coming out?
what kind of community is there that supports you?
all that you gave for love
what was it that you gave for love?
what's it that you've given up for damn?
what's it that you've gotten for sucking
swallows of water?
the cadaver in the water
look no further
look no further
oh, more to come
later this month
we may have entered the future
wanderlust! from island to island
we may catch up with one another
possibly there's more to life than this
possibly there's more to life
this is probably going to be hard
but we'll get to it

i'm a path of cinders
burning under your feet
you're the one who walks me
i'm your one way street
i'm a whisper in the water
secret for you to hear
you're the one who grows distant
when i beckon you near

oh i
this is really dangerous
i'm a fountain of blood
in the shape of a girl
you're the bird on the brim
hides the rest
you're the terrestrial body
hypnotised by the ocean
hypnotised by the sun
don't you get sensitive on me
'cause i know you're all right
there's nothing wrong
there's plenty to do
there's plenty to be desired
there's plenty to be desired
but more than enough
there's enough
there's plenty to do
hypnotised
and the pleasure is always found
i'm always found
in the chic
sporting a summer dress
layered with tributes
the words 'hypnotised by the ocean' inscribed on my arms
as though sensing a precious body
please release this pressure of me
hypnotised
and the pleasure is always found
i'm always found
in the chic
sporting a summer dress
the words 'hypnotised by the ocean' inscribed on my arms
as though sensing a precious body
please release this pressure of me
hypnotised

i've seen it all, i have seen the trees
i've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
i've seen a man killed by his best friend
and lives that were over before they were spent
i've seen what i was — i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru!
i'm happy to say i had better to do
what about china? have you seen the great wall?
all walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!
and the man you will marry?
the home you will share?
to be honest, i really don't care...
you've never been to niagara falls?
i have seen water, it's water, that's all...
the eiffel tower, the empire state?
my pulse was as high on my very first date!
your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?
to be honest, i really don't care...
i've seen it all, i've seen the dark
i've seen the brightness in one little spark
i've seen what i chose and i've seen what i need
and that is enough, to want more would be greed
i've seen what i was and i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you've seen it all and all you have seen
you can always review on your own little screen
the light and the dark, the big and the small
just keep in mind — you need no more at all
you've seen what you were and know what you'll be
you've seen it all — there is no more to see!

i miss you
but i haven't met you yet
so special
but it hasn't happened yet
you are gorgeous
but i haven't met you yet
i remember
but it hasn't happened yet
and if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i will meet you
i was peaking
but it hasn't happened yet
i haven't been given
my best souvenir
i miss you
but i haven't met you yet
i know your habits
but wouldn't recognise you yet
and if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i miss you
i'm so impatient
i can't stand the wait
when will i get my cuddle?
who are you?
i know by now that you'll arrive
by the time i stop waiting
i miss you

all the modern things
like cars and such
have always existed
they've just been waiting in a mountain
for the right moment
listening to the irritating noises
of dinosaurs and people
dabbling outside
engin fylgist alveg
sólin sekkur
engin sér við mér
það er sól þegar
andar inn í mér
hann bítur mig
hann bítur mig
já, hann kemur með
fylgir eftir mér
telur með
siglir eftir mér
all the modern things
have always existed
they've just been waiting
to come out
and multiply
and take over
it's their turn now

you think you're denying me of something
well, i've got plenty
you're the one who's missing out
but you won't notice
until after five years
if you'll live that long
you'll wake up
all loveless
i dare you
to take me on
i dare you
to show me your palms
i'm so bored with cowards
that say they want
then they can't handle
you can't handle love
you can't handle love
you just can't handle
i dare you
to take me on
i dare you
to show me your palms
what's so scary?
not a threat in sight
you just can't handle
you can't handle love
you
====================
and as the new year comes around
i'm not far away
from your side
i'm very close
our mutual instinct
is driving us
exploiting us
giving rise to many temptations
some think i love them as i love them
some believe i despotism
most fears of death
aren't realised
so wake up, wake up now
today has never happened
and it doesn't frighten me
i wouldn't dream of it
denied reality
i'd be lying
still in my bed
reading a tragic story
the words i slowly removed
i can't get no
thank you god for you daddy
i cannot get no
i can't get no
i can't get no
i can't get no

a juxtapositioning fate
find our mutual coordinates
moments of clarity are so rare
i better document this
at last the view is fierce
all that matters is
who is open chested
and who has coagulated
who can share and
who has shut down the chances?
show me emotional respect, oh respect, oh respect
and i have emotional needs, oh needs, oh ooh
i wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, oh ooh
what is it that i have
that makes me feel your pain?
like milking a stone
to get you to say it
who is open?
and who has shut up
and if one feels closed
how does one stay open?
we have emotional needs, oh needs, oh needs, oh ooh
i wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, ooh
oh, show some emotional respect, oh respect, oh ooh
a juxtapositioning fate
find our mutual coordinates

we live on a mountain
right at the top
there's a beautiful view
from the top of the mountain
every morning i walk towards the edge
and throw little things off
like car parts, bottles and cutlery
or whatever i find lying around
it's become a habit
a way to start the day
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
it's not easy being a homestead
to be safe up here with you
i go through
====================
i'm flexible, i'm contagious
i like to play by the rules
no one wants to follow his lead
and play by the rules
i dare you to step forward
and play by the rules
and if you don't, then the whole world is on fire
just lean into the crack
just lean into the crack
and it will tremble
ever so nicely
notice how it sparkles
down there
i can decide
what i give
but it's not up to me
what i get given
unthinkable surprises
about to happen
but what they are
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
well it never really was
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
oh, illuminar
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
oh, it never really was

well it never really was
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
it's not up to you

oh, it never really was
it's not up to you
well it never really was
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
there's too much
clinging
to peak
there's too much
pressure

she always knows when people need stroking
and is attracted to deathbeds and divorces
i dreamt she cared for my dying grandfather
lying naked face down on his bed
she insists on total presence
and knows how to get through to the rest of us
she has entered me thousandfold often
and undone knots at my most awkward
music, music loves too
she reaches out to orphans and refugees
embraces them with thermal blankets
her favourite childhood moments
were at a hospital for the disabled
i've seen her offer empathy to widows
she attends funerals of strangers
her strongest memory
is feeding children with leprosy
music heals too
i'm here to defend it

in a forest pitch-dark
glowed the tiniest spark
it burst into a flame

living by herself
in a heart full of dust
lives a creature called lust
it surprises and scares
like me, like me

moth delivers her message
unexplained on your collar
crawling in silence, a simple excuse

in a tower of steel
nature forges a deal
to raise wonderful hell

looking at the sky
he's got three boys
and one on bended knee
and he's got a big party going on
it's getting gloomy
he never leaves his place
it's become a habit
he sets his watch to the sky
and sets off the tide
all the lights are up there
it's a big deal
he's got his lights waiting
he always goes in and out of the deals
he always gets his money's hand
and the lights are all up there
it's a big deal
he's got his lights waiting
he's got his lights waiting
he's got his lights waiting
he's got his lights waiting for you
in a big, ugly house
complete with big windows
he always has his eye on the sky
he always will
he always will
and his eyes are always on the sky

i wake up
and the day feels a-broken
i tilt my head
i'm using too much fuel
and not enough energy
i'm throwing off layers
i'm building a strong wall
but enough is enough
if you manage
then the day will be lost
i'll be alone
and the evening strolls by
i'll be dancing with him
faster than a shooting star
he's aiming at the right place
he's making sure everything is perfect
he knows what he's doing
he knows when to turn his glare back
and off
he's trying to make the right choice
'cause when i thought i was done
i'm happy now
till it's over, and then
the day feels a-broken

say hey, hey, hey
that's what i say

day after day
alone on a hill
the strange guy
where the rooster crowed
no one wants to know about him
and they point where he goes
he still holds out alone
do you know about a fool on a hill
he can see a precious sun
and his eyes see more
they see a world, a hidden world
ask him for help
he comes quickly
he that has thousand voices
whisper the truth quickly
no one wants to listen to him
or the sound in a secret song
which he doesn't know at all
do you know about a fool on a hill
no one wants to see him
in the hut in the south with a lake
he still holds out alone

no one wants to listen to him
and they point where he goes
he still holds out alone

down in the cellar in the boho zone
i went looking for some sweet inspiration, oh well
just another hard time band with negro affectations
i was a hopeful in rooms like this
when i was working cheap
it's an old romance, the boho dance
hasn't gone to sleep
but even on the scuffle
the cleaner's press was in my jeans
and any eye for detail
caught a little lace along the seams
and you were in the parking lot
subterranean by your own design
the virtue of your style inscribed
on your contempt for mine
jesus was a beggar, he was rich in grace
and solomon kept his head in all his glory
it's just that some steps outside the boho dance
have a fascination for me
a camera pans the cocktail hour
behind a blind of potted palms
and finds a lady in a paris dress
with runs in her nylons
you read those books where luxury
comes as a guest to take a slave
books where artists in noble poverty
go like virgins to the grave
don't you get sensitive on me
'cause i know you're just too proud
you couldn't step outside the boho dance now
even if good fortune allowed
like a priest with a pornographic watch
looking and longing on the sly
sure it's stricken from your uniform
but you can't get it out of your eyes
nothing is capsulized in me
on either side of town
the streets were never really mine
not mine, not mine, these glamor gowns

all of my mouth was kissing him
now, into the air, i am missing him
is this excess texting a blessing?
two music nerds obsessing
he reminds me of the love in me
i'm celebrating on a vibrancy
sending each other mp3s
falling in love to a song
this handsomest of wickermen
he asked if i could wait for him
now, how many lightyears this interim
while i fall in love with his songs?
his hands are good in protecting me
touching and caressing me
but would it be trespassing
wanting him to be blissing me
robbing him of his youth?
cliffhanger like suspension
my longing has formed its own skeleton
bridging the gap between singletons
sending each others these songs
the interior of these melodies
is perhaps where we are meant to be
our physical union a fantasy
i just fell in love with a song
so, i reserve my own intimacies
i bundle them up in packages
my rawward longing far too visceral
did i just fall in love with love?

i'm a fountain of blood
in the shape of a girl
you're the bird on the brim
hypnotised by the whirl
drink me, make me feel real
wet your beak in the stream
game we're playing is life
love's a two way dream
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a path
====================
it's just like sleeping
day and night
while you complete a pattern
drawnigg
you say you want to be immortal
i say i want to be a tree
drew orchids, i suck my tongue
in remembrance of you
you say you dreamt of me
you've got back problems
the devil cuts loose and gives chase
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you

crystals grow like plants
listen how they grow
i weave my own love

internal pathways full of energy
revolutionize them

i'm going hunting for mysteries

i'm going to prove the impossible exists
this is really dangerous
but worth all the effort
cover my eyes
i'm going to prove the impossible really exists

there is yet another one
that follows me
wherever i go
and supports me
all this tooth is warmth-like

i feel all of you
now belong

archaeologist: oh my god
what's going on?

he's gone nuts
he believes in a black box
he's inside it
he's seen black

all that exists
is fear and detail
and detail, detail

i shout back at the sky
and demand answers
the earth gets tired
and tired of it's troubles
and the problems they cause
they demand detail

i'm the earth from below
silly positions on camera
but all too real ones being taken up
by humans
you can tell from the way they smell
that empathy for others is a powerful drug
i'm a hunter, you're a hunter
you can't say no to hope
you can't say no to happiness

i swallow it and re-enter it

i don't want to suffer

you can't say no to hope
i'm a hunter, you're a hunter
you can't say no to happiness

there is a man
who kills his victims
and who tells lies
no matter what happened
he will not return it
for fear of retribution
from where he goes
i will never know him
for he is a telling
tale of deposition
the stubborn demand for answers
justice for him
how does one renounce his old ways
and accept the world as it is?

i had read your customs

and you said you had seen what you lost
you had seen what you had gained
and if something important
was to come
later that year
you would see it
possibly i doubted
but you never thought you would see it

it would be a mistake
to take our word for it later
that would be folly

hearing guitars

i seem to walk as though i have wings
bump into things

first snow of winter
i'm walking hills and valleys
adore this mystical fog!
this fucking mist!
these cliffs are just showing off!
then the body memory kicks in
i mime my home mountains
the moss that i'm made of
i redeem myself
i've been wrestling my fate
do i accept this ending?
will i accept my death
or struggle claustrophobic?
fought like a wolverine
with my destiny
refuse to accept what was meant to be
then the body memory kicks in
and i trust the unknown
unfathomable imagination
surrender to future
oh, how to capture all this love
and find a pathway for it
like threading an ocean through a needle
river through a keyhole
crawling against time
tuner than air
time to coalesce
earth quicksand

i travel all around the city
no one wants to see me
there's no-one to catch me
i'm on a roll
this is a real mess
i heathen temple
here i go
slamming against me
stirring at water's edge
dirty volcano
i'm immersed
this is a real mess
here i go
slamming against me
stirring at water's edge
my heart's burned
i'm turning red
i'm burning through
this is a real mess
i bleach coral
i'm keeping it face
clean off
i'm trying to make sense of this
i'm making huge mistakes
i know it may not work
so i'm going to show you
what i've got
in jaw fallen
from peak to peak
in jaw fallen from peak to peak
i'm using this as a template
so you can follow which way you want
just do your best
and give yourself high
your joke is off the charts
and the police are waiting
notice how i'm using this as a base
and working towards change
it's become a cult
i shout and i weave
i'm using this as a base
and trying to change places

this is a very important message
please release this pressure before it too can enter your hearts
i'm so broken
heðan-liður-afte-care
please release this pressure before it too can enter your hearts
while i mourn
i pray to the earth from the bottom of the sea
forgive us, our family
we're refugees from war
falling into the sea
swallow us alive
into the warm sea air
sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
i won't denounce our origin
sue me, sue me, sue me, all you want
i won't denounce our origin
i've ducked and dived
like the mother in salomon's tale
to spare our girl
i won't let her get cut in half ever
but it's time to teach her some dignity
sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
i won't denounce our origin
sue me, sue me, sue me, all you want
i won't, i won't denounce our origin
no, i won't
he took it from his father
who took it from his father
who took it from his father
let's break this curse
so it won't fall on our daughter
and her daughter
and her daughter
won't let this sink into her dna
sue me, sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
i won't let you denounce our origin
sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
denounce our origin, no, i won't
can't take her suffer
it's so unfair
the sins of the fathers
they just fucked it all up
we had the best family
we had it all
we had it all in our hands
he just pulled us through the wringer
narcissistic

my throat was stuffed
my mouth was sewn up
banned from making noise
i was not heard
remove this hindrance
my throat feels stuck
i was not allowed
i was not heard
i was not heard
i was not heard
there is vocal sadness
i was separated
from what i can do
what i'm capable of
need to break up
vicious habits
do something i haven't done
i haven't done before
in vow of silence
i explore the negative space
around my mouth
it implodes
black hole
with jaw fallen in
in fallen jaw
jaw fallen in
i am not hurt
i am not hurt
this tunnel has enabled
thousands of sounds
i thank this trunk
noise pipe, noise pipe
i have followed a path
that took sacrifices
now i sacrifice this scar
can you cut it off?

one hand
loves the other
so much on me
born stubborn, me
will always be
before you count "1, 2, 3"
i will have grown my own private branch
of this tree
you, gardener
you, discipliner
domestically
i can obey all of your rules
and still be, be

will i accept my death

once you fell out of love
our love couldn't carry you
and i didn't even notice
for our love kept me safe from death
you doubted the light
and the shelter it can give
for in love we are immortal
eternal and safe from death
if i regret us
i'm denying my soul to grow
don't remove my pain
it is my chance to heal
we carry the same wound
but have different cures
similar injuries
but opposite remedies
after our love ended
your arms don't carry me
without love i feel the abyss
understand your fear of death
i will not forget
this notget
will you not regret
having love let go?
after our love ended
your spirit entered me
now we are the guardians
we'll keep her safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death

love will keep us safe from death?

who then downturned her
the paralyzing juice of rejection
his veins full of lead
he's left with loving what he lost
more than what he has
my snakeskin cold in the dark
but warms up in the light
i then upturned a green eyed giant
who upturned and entered me
will we stop seeing what unites us
but only what differs?
the ghosts of old loves
hovering around his orifices, his orifices...

you thread souls into one beam
the love you gave and have been given
weave into your own dream

i've seen it all, i have seen the trees
i've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
i've seen a man killed by his best friend
and lives that were over before they were spent
i've seen what i was — i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru!
i'm happy to say i had better to do
what about china? have you seen the great wall?
all walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!
and the man you will marry?
the home you will share?
to be honest, i really don't care...
you've never been to niagara falls?
i have seen water, it's water, that's all...
the eiffel tower, the empire state?
my pulse was as high on my very first date!
your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?

if had a heart
it would take me…

why can't you give her room?
and a pillow to sleep in
and a warm blanket for her to sleep in
why doesn't your mother like you?
it would be unfair
and it's not right
why should i love you too?
you can't say no to hope
and haskell gave little to no thought
to the possibility of happiness
this is an alarm-call-us-howling
how can i push you over the edge?
and still be welcome?
i've seen what i was and i know what i'll be

one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it will all come true
one day
when you're ready
one day, one day
when you're up to it
the atmosphere
will get lighter
and two suns ready
to shine just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it will all make sense
one day
you will blossom
one day, one day
when you're ready
an aeroplane
will curve gracefully
around the volcano
with the eruption that never lets you down
i can feel it
i can feel it
and the beautifullest
fireworks are burning
in the sky, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh
just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day
one day, one day
one day



one day, one day
no one will see
this is absolutely essential
today i am giving my best
this is an alarm-call-us-howling
i see what i've been
and i know what i'll be
i've seen what i was and i know what i'll be
i've seen what i was and i know what i'll be
and the littleness of her praises
has never been heard before
in heritable clarity
i see what she has been
and know what she'll be
i've seen what she was and i know what she'll be
i've seen what she was and i know what she'll be
then she complains
her name is a she
and it hurts
i heal it in two
and if she heals it in two
or if she heals it in two
or if she heals it in two
one hurt, one hurt
for her to suffer
one hurt, one hurt
for her to accept
the hurt is mutual
and if she heals it in two
or if she heals it in two
or if she heals it in two
or if she heals it in two
one hurt, one hurt
for her to suffer
i heal it in two
i send my regards

i find myself out gazing at stars
hearing guitars
like someone in love
sometimes the things i do astound me
mostly whenever you're around me
lately
i seem to walk as though i have wings
bump into things
====================
down in the cellar in the boho zone
i went looking for some sweet inspiration, oh well
just another hard time band with negro affectations
i was a hopeful in rooms like this
when i was working cheap
it's an old romance, the boho dance
hasn't gone to sleep
but even on the scuffle
the cleaner's press was in my jeans
and any eye for detail
caught a little lace along the seams
and you were in the parking lot
subterranean by your own design
the virtue of your style inscribed
on your contempt for mine
jesus was a beggar, he was rich in grace
and solomon kept his head in all his glory
it's just that some steps outside the boho dance
have a fascination for me
a camera pans the cocktail hour
behind a blind of potted palms
and finds a lady in a paris dress
with runs in her nylons
you read those books where luxury
comes as a guest to take a slave
books where artists in noble poverty
go like virgins to the grave
don't you get sensitive on me
'cause i know you're just too proud
you couldn't step outside the boho dance now
even if good fortune allowed
like a priest with a pornographic watch
looking and longing on the sly
sure it's stricken from your uniform
but you can't get it out of your eyes
nothing is capsulized in me
on either side of town
the streets were never really mine
not mine, not mine, these glamor gowns

all of my mouth was kissing him
now, into the air, i am missing him
is this excess texting a blessing?
two music nerds obsessing
he reminds me of the love in me
i'm celebrating on a vibrancy
sending each other mp3s
falling in love to a song
this handsomest of wickermen
he asked if i could wait for him
now, how many lightyears this interim
while i fall in love with his songs?
his hands are good in protecting me
touching and caressing me
but would it be trespassing
wanting him to be blissing me
robbing him of his youth?
cliffhanger like suspension
my longing has formed its own skeleton
bridging the gap between singletons
sending each others these songs
the interior of these melodies
is perhaps where we are all going
trapped under enormous circumstances
my heart and my womb separated
we're naked and laughing
at how little we share
at the expense of all
let's step up and make a difference
let's make a difference today
we can make a difference today
we can make a difference today
make a difference in the hearts of the children
it makes a difference
if a movie is cut short

it is time
the hours were so short
a helicopter would take us
freeing us from the customs
is where i want to be
all that no one sees
it is a deep cut throat conversation
with multiple doctors
they tell you what to do and don't say
i can't say no to hope
i have seen what i chose
and i can't say no to hope

if living is seeing
i'm holding my breath
in wonder - i wonder
what happens next?
if you remember
your mother's house
was never mine
and her last breath
is the only sound
i've been given
is ever seen
your mother's house
was never mine
and her last breath
is the only sound
you've ever heard
your mother's house
was never mine
and her last breath
is the only sound
you've ever heard
you've seen what i've been made to give
i'm a part-time mission
i'm not going to say no to you
you've seen what i've been made to give
you've seen what i've been made to give
i'm a part-time mission
you didn't have to speak
i understand
you said you would
soon you'll be given
your first cup of coffee
and a warm blanket
all in your name
i'm a part-time mission
i'm not going to say no to you
you've seen what i've been made to give
you've seen what i've been made to give
you've seen what i've been made to give
you didn't have to speak
so simple
but still powerful
and you didn't have to speak
you just had to
speak
what you say flows
nature has a knack for organizing
she will take your place
and will you wake her up
all scared off
can you say
====================
my heart is so broken
i'm puzzling
here i go
trying to run ahead of that
heart-break-train
thinking
it will never catch up with me
i'm so broken
heðan-liður-afte-care
so broken
heðan-biður-afte-care
yeah, ha-ee, ha-ee, ha-mmm
heðan-biður-afte-care
yeah, ha-ee, ha-ee, ha-mmm
mm-for-mum-funder-scheme
i'm so broken
heðan-biður-afte-care
yeah, ha-ee, ha-ee, ha-mmm
heðan-biður-afte-care
yeah, ha-ee, ha-ee, ha-mmm
mm-for-mum-funder-scheme
i'm so
completely unhealable
i'm not going back
where i started
this is our last homestead
we've been here before
and no one wants to see us
and no one wants to know about us
and we've never been to the White Mountains
no one wants to know about us
and we've never been to the Sky
is where they all are
i cannot say no to hope
i cannot wait any more
to get down to business
i urge you to consider volunteering
next time you think you can't do something
go downtown and volunteer
don't walk me wrong
there are volunteer places in downtown
just follow the signs
where people who are just joining the mission have gone
and done something amazing, like joining a musical
did it come undone quickly?
perfectly!
just follow the signs
where people who have just joined the mission have gone
and gone about their daily business
have gone about their day
don't go downtown and volunteer
don't walk me wrong
there are volunteer places in downtown
just follow the signs
where people who have just joined the mission have gone
and gone about their daily business
have gone about their day
don't go downtown and volunteer
don't walk me wrong
there are volunteer places in downtown
just follow the signs
where people who have just joined the mission have gone
and gone about their daily business
have gone about their day
don't go downtown and volunteer
don't walk me wrong
there are volunteer places in downtown
just follow the signs
where people who have just joined the mission have gone

his embrace, a song of love

by the power of song
i can change the world
for the better
and if one breathes
easily takes over
i see who else is around
and sees how many people
i see who else is around
i see who else is around
swirl around my head, see who is bright
and take over
and if one feels down
and doesn't want to be
i can change the world
for the better
and if one feels down
and doesn't want to be
i can change the world
for the better
and if one feels down
and doesn't want to be
i can change the world
for the better
and if one feels down
and doesn't want to be
i can change the world
for the better
and if one feels down
and doesn't want to be
i can change the world
for the better
and if one feels down
and doesn't want to be
i can change the world
for the better
and if one feels down
and doesn't want to be
i can change the world
for the better
and if one feels down
and doesn't want to be
i can change the world
for the better

all of my mouth was kissing him
now, into the air, i am missing him
is this excess texting a blessing?
two songs in hand
he's driving me nuts
i can't get no... satisfaction
this is a daily occurrence
i'm turning 50
it's Sunday morning
no one is home
and i'm alone
all of my lips were kissing him
now, onto another's
my heart is turning 50
still craving something
eat this! taste this! get high!
this is an offer to make made to you
you are the ocean around my head
turn around and die
i'm the resistance
turn the tide
i'm the one who's missing you
turn the tide
i'm the one who's missing you
my headphones are all the way around them
they're missing the jam
so i called the police
they've come for me all wrong
and they're still ringing
they're the ones who said
====================
appreciate
the pleasure is all mine
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let this be a warning
don't let this scare you off
you can't say no to hope
let's open up
this door will take me in
this way an open field
will take me
in all my clothes
honor my origin
i'm a hunter
this is a dangerous zone
but the thrill of hunt comes pouring in
this is the ocean
he leads a people
he brings his people
he brings his people
he brings his people
he brings his people
he brings his people
i'm a hunter
this is the land of opportunity
it gives me comfort
to be safe up here with you
there's more to life than this
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
oh i
oh i
if one day brings another's pain
i shall not forget
this is how i heal
in each of our bodies
we heal by tattoos
we heal by cetacean transmutation

oh i

you've got to manage
i won't sympathize
anymore
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me
you're all right
there's nothing wrong
you can always go on around
you're all right
i'm just not feeling it
excuse me
but hey, i've got plenty
you've got to manage
you know that there's more to life than this
you know that i'm capable of
you know that i love you
you know that i love you
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm
break the charm

if living is seeing
i'm holding my breath
in wonder - i wonder
what happens next?
a new world, a new day to see
see, see
i'm softly walking on air
halfway to heaven from here
sunlight unfolds in my hair
oh i
it rains
so don't get wet
you've got to stay hydrated
you've got to stay hydrated
sunlight unfolds in my hair
oh i
once again
you're all right
there's more to life than this
you know that there's more to life
you know that i'm capable of
you know that i love you
so
====================
yeah, i know
yeah, i know
yeah, i know
it's tricky when
you feel a wall of steel
around your neck
asking you to say what you want
is a powerful deterrent
buttons, controls, and drivers
none of which you had thought of
and yet which you gave to them
and yet which you gave to them
and yet which you gave to them?
the impossible thing
it feels like home
and all is full of hope
all is full of hope
all is full of hope
is where i'm zenith
still unraveling
the mysteries of my mind
singing and puzzling
the mind around me
faster than a dream
lately
i find solace in logic
here lies the key
to solomoncy
here lies the key
to happiness always
the more time i spend with my family
the merrier!
here lies the key
to happiness always
the more time i spend with my family

morse coding!
i find happiness everywhere
all is full of hope
all is full of hope
all is full of hope

still unraveling
the mysteries of my mind
singing and puzzling
the mind around me
faster than a dream
lately
i find solace in logic

here lies the key
to solomoncy
here lies the key
to happiness always
the more time i spend with my family

lately
i find solace in logic

one word, one word
to express myself
all that i gave them
was of little use
if they thought i could get away with it
i'd go down to their hideout
there i will not be found
they torture and slaughter me
without mercy
i give them mercy
free of charge
in their black hide
my throat is stuffed
my mouth is gagged
understandable
i know there's more to life than this
but something huge is coming
and i don't know where
it is evening
and i'm alone
and my mother and son up at night
talking
smoking and drinking
up to her mouth's level
but it's not falling
it's not burning
it's not becoming a nuisance
it's just another crime
a violent crime
it's not pooping
i'm going to catch you
train-whistles are too sweet
i'm going to give you the taste of rejection
but something huge is coming
and i won't let you return it
it's not uphill: it's in the air
it's not uphill: it's in the air
i'm going to catch you
make it right
there for you
i'm going to catch you
show you up
there's more to life
it's not uphill: it's in the air
it's not uphill: it's in the air
oh, more to life
then elsewhere
it's not uphill: it's in the sky
lit by the Milky Way
and the white dwarf in the Cygnus
it makes me wanna jump
it makes me wanna laugh
it makes me wanna go down to the harbor
i won't let you return it
it's not uphill: it's in the sky
it's not uphill: it's in the sky
i'm going to catch you
make it right
there for you

while you are away
my e-mail gets lost in web
and i find it again
this time in the bin
this time inside the safe
this time inside the safe
where the hawk is not kafkaesque
it is a truth
hidden in the clutter
i find it again
this time inside the safe
this time inside the safe
where the hawk is not kafkaesque
it is a truth
hidden in the clutter
i find it again
this time in the bin
this time inside the safe
this time inside the safe
where the hawk is not kafkaesque
it is a truth
hidden in the clutter
i find it again
this time in the bin
this time inside the safe

all this effortless love
just that kiss
was all there is
every cell in my body
lined up
for you
always
always
always
always

to be completely honest
maybe it would be a joke
to be completely honest
maybe it would be a joke
i know i say that i mean it
it well
but no amount of promises
embraces
the last bit

====================
refuse to accept
what is unbridled love?
and what is unchecked greed?
unpolished by nurture
flickering sun-flame
unpolished by nurture
flickering sun-flame
unpolished by nurture
what is undefinable?
and what is undefinable?
to be ungrateful, to be ungrateful
unpolished by nurture
unpolished by nurture
unpolished by nurture
what is unbreakable?
and can't be impatient
shot this morning baby!
it takes courage to be humble
it takes courage to be humble
i have seen what i truly am
i have seen what i have not
and if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i will meet you there
i was shy at best
but this is deeper than that
i'm deeper than that
i'm deeper than that
i'm deeper than that
i'm deeper than that
you don't have to speak
i feel
embrace your secret
you feel where i want to be
i'm embracing something very, very important
this is very, very, very, very, very, very, very close
you know i love you
you know, you know
you know that i love you
you know that?
you know that?
you know that i love you?

i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is where i'm staying
this is my home
i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is where i'm staying
this is my home

one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it will all come true
one day
when you're ready
one day, one day
when you're up to it
the atmosphere
will get lighter
and two suns ready
to shine just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it will all make sense
one day
you will blossom
one day, one day
when you're ready
an aeroplane
will curve gracefully
around the volcano
with the eruption that never lets you down
i can feel it
i can feel it
and the beautifullest
fireworks are burning
in the sky, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh
just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
it will all come true
one day
one day, one day

genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
so warm
sounds go through the muscles
these abstract, wordless movements
move, move, move, move, move
they start off cells that haven't been touched before
these cells are virgins
waking up slowly waking up
waking up slowly wake up
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
nothing will be the same
i'm asleep
i'm fast asleep
i like this resonance
it elevates me
i don't recognise myself
this is very, very, very, very, very, very quiet
i'm fast asleep
i'm asleep
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
i'm fast asleep now
you're still with me
i'm fast asleep
i'm asleep
my headphones
they saved, saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

i shuffle around the tectonic plates in my chest
you know i gave it all
try to match our continents
to change seasonal shift
to form a mutual core
as fast as your fingernail grows
the atlantic ridge drifts
to counteract distance
you know i gave it all
can you hear the effort
of the magnetic strife?
shuffling of columns
to form a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
uso's century in debt
i'm fast asleep now
you're still with me
i'm fast asleep
i'm asleep
my headphones
they saved, saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

i shuffle around the tectonic
====================
at the heart of love
i will always be there to catch you
and always be with you
always be with you
always be with you
always be with you
always be with you
always be with you
probably will always be there to catch you
and always be with you
and always be with you
probably will always be there to catch you
and always be there to be seen
you were always there to catch me
and always be there to be seen
you were always there to catch me
and always be there to know
i always know where you are
you were always there to catch me
you were always there to make me see
you were always there to make you see
you were always there to make you see
and always be there to be seen
you were always there to catch me
and always be there to be seen

his arms are all around me
they tie me so
they heal me
from many causes
none at all
he heals me
from many causes
none at all
he heals me
from many causes
none at all
he heals me
heals me
and always be there to be seen
heals me
heals me
heals me
heals me
always to be there to be seen
every bit as much
always to be there
to be safe up here with you
it is very often that kind soul
comes to me and says, 'hey, hey', 'i'll take care of you'
and that's all there is
there's nothing i'd love to do more
than spare you from that burden
it would be a disaster, really, if
you got hit by a car
or another
and i'm blinded
or anything
you'd be dead before i get there
you'd be lurking around town
looking for some answers
generations of people
dreaming about the day they'd be dead if
nothing was to do so
why do the obvious?
look no further
look no further
look no further
it's so unfair
it's unfair
it's unfair
it's unfair
oh it's swell, it's swell
i've seen it all
i've seen the swell in me
it's become a dream
a secret pact
i'm sharing with you
the rawhide
secret pact
embrace you inside
and enjoy!
dream come true
your body language
possessed of magical
sensitivity?
now, take me out of this
this is for you
you're gonna have to find out for yourself
you're gonna have to find out for yourself
you're gonna have to find out for yourself
there'salways gonna be a reason
you've never seen a flower
you've seen a man
you've seen a snake
you've seen a rose
you've seen a rose, you've seen a
you've seen a reason
you've never seen a flower
you've seen a man
you've seen a snake
you've seen a man
you've seen a serpent
you've seen a man
you've seen a path
through his feet
a camera
in his mouth
a messenger
in his hooves
a coven of like-minded
parents
working together
to make sense of all
external forces
internal struggle
coincidence?
chance?
what's the lesser of two evils
if a suicide bomber
manages to kill her target or not?
to be honest, i really don't care
i could carry on
lately
i find myself holding hands
passions i haven't felt in years
i'm practically drowning
all that staying done
i can't say no more
no to happiness
i've seen what i chose
and i know what i'll find
the beauty in compromise
the beauty in compromise
no to happiness
i can't say no more
i can't say no more
say nothing
i'm a wall
between evils
nothing will be the same
i'm a wall
between evils
everything will be the same
i'm a wall
protecting you
lynch group
protect you
justice
i'm a wall
protecting you
lynch group
protect you
justice

he's the beautifullest
looking gorgeous
living by the ocean
heading his or her dive
hawks and sparrows
shot the breeze
with a flowered beard
shoot for the enlightenment
no to happiness
no to wall
i'm a wall
protecting you
lynch group
protect you
justice

behind the scenes
doing the talking
leadership
i meet people who say the same
works for them"
they make me feel better
they make me feel better

listen how they grow

when i grow up
i'll have to break apart
things
that once were
carnage
and now they're broken
carnage
and the things i do
now are superstition
 superstition
just ask the Devil
who fished them
or what made them tick
or what made them tick
or what made them tick?

i can't get no
no, no, no
hey, hey, hey
i can't get no
i can't get no

a wound is a wound
a scar is a wound
a scar is a wound

i can't get no
she said it best:
"thy foolish stare

a wound is a wound
a scar is a wound
a chest wound
once again
a soldier's chest
suffice it to say, i'm extremely, extremely, extremely, extremely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely naked
and i have no emotions, i don't enjoy being hurt
i'm already hurting myself
and if you think i'll get hurt again
i'm already hurting myself
and if you think i'll get hurt again
you are already traitors
i'm already witch-hunting
i'm already turning my back
on the world
and the world

army of me

when i'm alone and life is making me lonely
i can't get no
no, no, no

i don't mind relationships
i'm not too bothered about relationships
====================
ink
the habits of
the forgotten boys
in jupiter's orbit
looking for some kind of relationship
this isn't an episode about sex
it's about courage
moratorium
it's not meant to be a strife

when i spot someone who is same height as you
and goes to same record stores
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
when i hear someone with same accent as yours
asking directions with the same beard as yours
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
isn't it odd?
isn't it peculiar?
these statistics of my mind
shuffling your features
assembling a man
googling love
warming my heart on this log fire of love

i can sense it
something important
is about to happen
it's coming up
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
we just met
and i know i'm a bit too intimate
but something huge is coming up
and we're both included
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
i don't know my future after this weekend
and i don't want to
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality, sensuality

he turned me down, i then downturned another
who then downturned her
the paralyzing juice of rejection
his veins full of lead
he's left with loving what he lost
more than what he has
my snakeskin cold in the dark
but warms up in the light
i then upturned a green eyed giant
who upturned and entered me
will we stop seeing what unites us
but only what differs?
the ghosts of old loves
hovering around his orifices, his orifices...
as you narrate your own hearttale
you thread souls into one beam
the love you gave and have been given
weave into your own dream
i trust my cells to rearchive
my love historic stream

looking hard for
moments of shine
from twilight

i've seen it all, i have seen the trees
i've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
i've seen a man killed by his best friend
and lives that were over before they were spent
i've seen what i was — i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru!
i'm happy to say i had better to do
what about china? have you seen the great wall?
====================
geopolitical?
what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if she kills them or dies in vain?
nature has fixed no limits on our hopes
oh, what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if her bump was fake or if it was real?
here's my version of it
eternal whirlwind
i have fostered since childhood
well, i don't care
love is all
i dare to drown
to be proven wrong

when your eyes pause on the ball
that hangs on the third branch from the star
you remember why it is dark
and why it gets light again
the earth, like all living things, slopes in its seat
and, as it slopes, it transmutates heat
i ofd into heat

i have a recurrent dream
every time i lose my voice
i swallow little glowing lights
my husband and i are staying with
a lake where the sky is clear blue
and the home's dark and the home's white
every time i feel a hoarseness
i swallow little glowing lights
my husband and i are staying with
a beautiful city in the middle of the night
with ancient vatnajökul
sketch out of all the figurines
that I have read
about love
i can't get no
no, no, no
hey, hey, hey
i can't get no
love is all
i dare to become anything
and to fail would be a big deal
i can't get no
loss
no, no, no

unraveling
the ugly truth
about love
the world ain't always fair
i'm elastic
and i can't get used to it
and they still say
"let me in, let you in!"
jump off
your building's on fire
your doors and windows are all burned
your flags are burned up
your music's on fire
your dancers are all burned
your bravest
since the day i met you
it's still burning
so am i
but it's not yet the biggest deal
maybe it's the wrinkles in your skin
maybe it's the dough in your heart
maybe it's the sparkle in your eyes
that makes me want to hand myself over

all of my mouth was kissing him
now, into the future
possibly even
possibly even
possibly even
if you remember
there is yet another one
that I can look up to
that is even more perfect
it's not yet known when it will be

she always has some
about her that she keeps
about them filled with jewels
i'm not stopping
i'm going where
no one wants to go
and why: in the heart of the city
liters of sweat have been shed
in doing good
by your side
i'm buoyant
and the day is over
look at the stars
and the month
you are still there
come bring me some snacks
i'll be in the sky
overlook all beautiful
us, me, u
sunlight shines in my eyes
while you are away
i take pictures
in the sky, in the hearts
of all humanity

which directions should one take?
this is a thrill-seeker's dream
the girl on the sea bed
hides in the hair
can recall
the thrill of her first date
and the incredible turmoil that followed
the gut punch of a heart
the punch of a killer whale
and the kick that shattered the jaw
the moment when all is full of love
come for me, give me a pillow
and give me a blanket blanket
in short, the following morning
I will take a walk in the nature reserve
in the nature reserve, in the boho district
you will meet a beautiful lady
the boho dance is all about
brosa-like and there is little
to do but stare
at the sky and know that
there's always someone there
to catch me
you can always ask for help
there's a shed just off the road
you can always ask for help
lily of the valley, beyetta, beyetta
beyetta, beyetta

sunday is gloomy, the hours are slumberless
dearest of shadows I see are legion
nature has taken over
she turned herself in
picked her spots well
and where the rain has fallen
she remains faithful to her spot
sunday has a gloomy air
makes the downcast lashes of my eyes
notorious vandalism
it is a stain on my soul
a stain on my soul
a stain on my soul

the dark demands of the old
the light demands indeterminate
do not dismiss them!
the crafty soldier

the hunter was not my opponent
he is more than willing to fight
to the death
to preserve our species

i want to help you
always be with you

you don't have to speak
i understand
you know that i adore you
you know that i love you
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm
jump off
your building's on fire
and i'll catch you
i'll catch you
destroy all that is keeping you down
and then i'll nurse you
i'll nurse you

behind the scenes
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
to all this turmoil
i should sort it all out
and then i'll sort it all out
probably tomorrow
possibly today
possibly tonight
possibly morning
possibly evening
just that thought happened often
today is going to be huge
it will happen quickly
just with greater speed
it will be in the hands of the man
who has given it all
bigger and better off
and you will have to manage
you will manage, manage
it will be in the hands of the man

i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is where i'm staying
this is my home

i'm aiming squarely now to release some pressure
i'm trying to hide my feelings

what is the lesser of two evils
if a suicide bomber made to look pregnant
manages to kill her target or not?
what is the lesser of two evils?
if she kills them or dies in vain?
nature has fixed no limits on our hopes
oh, what is the lesser of two evils?
if her bump was fake or if it was real?
the earth, the moon and the man
are formed into a ball
and the shape is determined by the forces of desire
emancipation, emancipation
i chose this moment
to complete the transfer
now we are joined in feeling by
the soft tissue that plays host
to the heart that arranges

once you fell
this land is made of beams
the sea brings new finds
new plants and people
new cars and so on
this is going to sound too exciting
to be true
so exciting
but all the excitement about
is just wetting your seat
looking good in a lady's dress
the sky is veiled in a cloud
grey leaves are abundant
attracts males where they want
and if he scrawl a gentle word
to a girl's mouth
it will be read by a mind boggling number
and if he speaks well
you can say the words i want to hear
and if he speaks well
you can follow my lead and live
i go hunting for wisdom
all around me
and if he speaks well
you can say the words i want to hear
and if he speaks well
you can follow my lead and live
i'm going hunting for wisdom

all the love i give
to be safe up here with you
is where i want to be
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
i get along so well
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
oh i change at will
(music: angels pour into me from afar
and i can hear their directions through their eyes
as i walk along this mountain path
the words i give to my children)
oh i change at will
from angel to sylvan hound
octagon, polygon
stroke by stroke
stroke by stroke
he shows me my potential
he makes me his
i can feel his warmth
i can't dismiss it
he's not into it yet
but when will i get my first look?
will i fall in love or will i leap into the sky?
fear not, it will all come true
oh i change at will
from angel to sylvan hound
octagon, polygon
stroke by stroke
he shows me my potential
he makes me his
and then i'm led around the house
into a hidden chamber
where dancers in line play
denounce their sakes
and they stand motionless
watch as the world collapses
down around them
monstrous rain falls
light up the night
drops come flying
from the earthlike creatures
like a mushroom on a tree
 mushroom on a tree

i have been trying my best to make you happy
not to be unhappy

i have a recurrent dream
every time i lose my voice
i swallow little glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me
during the nights
they do a trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above my bed
while i'm asleep
my mother and son pour into me
warm glowing oil
into my wide open throat
i have a recurrent dream
every time i feel a hoarseness
i swallow warm glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me, oh
they make me feel so much better
they make me feel better

what's the lesser of two evils
if a suicide bomber made to look pregnant
manages to kill her target or not?
what's the lesser of two evils

when your eyes pause on the ball
that hangs on the third branch from the star
you remember why it is dark
and why it gets light again
the earth, like the heart, slopes in its seat
and, like that, it travels along an elliptical path
drawn into the darkness
an unpolished pearl
in sky-black palm of hand
flickering sun-flame
and then you remember
that you, yourself, you are a light-bearer, a light-bearer
receiving radiance from others
flickering sun-flame
unpolished earth in palm of hand

show me forgiveness
for having lost faith in myself
and let my own interior up
to inferior forces
the shame is endless
but if soon start forgiveness

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
i see who you are
i see who you.... are...

it may not always be so
and i say that if your lips
which i have loved
should touch another's
and your dear strong fingers clutch her heart
as mine in time not far away
if on another's face your sweet hair lay
in such a silence as i know
or such great writhing words as, uttering overmuch
stand helplessly before the spirit at bay
if this should be, i say if this should be
you of my heart, send me a little word
that i may go unto her, and take her hands saying
accept all happiness from me
then i shall turn my face
and hear one bird sing terribly afar in the lost lands

through the warmthest cord of care
your love was sent to me
i'm not sure what to do with it
or where to put it
i'm so close to tears
and so close to
simply calling you up
and simply suggesting
we go to that hidden place
that we go to that hidden place
we'll be in such a silence
that you may faint
and believe me
you may faint
and believe me
you may faint
and believe me
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
oh i
oh i
if living is seeing
i'm holding my breath
in wonderlake park
the eiffel tower
ossuments are being made of
these ancient Roman villas
look at the levelheadedness
of these people
they are trying so hard
to complete all the missions they've been given
and reached their peak
they're throwing stones at us
and throwing bombs
at least they're offering something
something meaningful
to the world
yeah, damn it
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
well, now that you've been given amen
it's not up to you
oh i
it's not up to you
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
try again
you're not here to lose
it's not up to you
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
well, now that you've been given amen
it's not up to you
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill

you're not here to lose
it's not up to you
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
well, now that you've been given amen
it's not up to you
there is always someone
to catch me
someone who will listen
someone who can guide me
and remember to always remember to forget
unthinkable consequences
i'm sure there are others like you
just that kiss
i was slightly shy
now i is much, much, much shy
i was slightly shy

i once had no fears
none at all
and then when
i had some
to my surprise
i grew to like both
scared or brave
without them
the thrill of fear
thought i'd never admit it
the thrill of fear
now greatly enjoyed with courage
when i once was
untouchable
innocence roared
still amazes
when i once was
innocent
it is still here
but in different places
neurosis
only
attaches
itself to
fertile
ground
where it can flourish
the thrill of fear
thought i'd never admit it
the thrill of fear
now greatly enjoyed with courage
when i once was
fearless
innocence roared
still amazes
untouchable
innocence
it is still here
but in different places
fear is a powerful drug
overcome it and
you think that you can do
anything
should i
save myself
for later
or generously give?
fear of
losing
energy
is draining
it locks up your chest
shuts down the heart
miserly
and stingy
let's open up: share!
when i once was
fearless
innocence roared
still amazes
untouchable
innocence
it is still here
but in different places

half full of dust
and lightning strikes
just for you
i can feel it
your sweat is salty

i can feel it
we are one big cloud
carnage
it is coming
i am penniless
the minute
it is over, the day has come
carnage
i am trespassing
one little step ahead
one little step back

it is nice and quiet, then suddenly all is full
carnage
the noise of daily life
i forget where it is, where it is
i forget all that it means
it is nice and quiet, then suddenly all is full

he turned his face towards mine
his features were grave
certainty like that of a man
who has just lost his father
and is holding himself in high regard
this is a vulgar saying about a boy
it is a vulgar saying about a boy
it is a vulgar saying
it is a vulgar saying
it expresses the most complete sexuality
no one is a boy and there is no man
there is a simple reason why
one day, someday soon soon soon
i will be erect
and multiply like birds
all over the land
every tree that hasn't fallen
its leaves been ripe for sacrifice
just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day, someday soon soon
i will be erect

one day, tomorrow morning
i will be erect

every tree that hasn't fallen
its leaves been ripe for sacrifice
just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it

while you are distracted
by emailing random people
offered solutions
to your puzzle
i ring the bell
i send the message
that whenever you are ready
one, two, three
rings the bell
the twilight is falling
i have been empowered
to take the first step
i am able
to complete the task at hand
one day at a time
soon i will be erect
and multiply like birds
all over the land
every tree that hasn't fallen
its leaves been ripe for sacrifice
just for you

softly
you say you love me, i see why
you've been avoiding me for months
but when you finally do come out
one day, one day
i will be erect
and multiply like birds
all over the land
every tree that hasn't fallen
its leaves been ripe for sacrifice
just for you
softly
you say you love me, i know why
you've been avoiding me for months
but when you finally do come out

softly
you say you love me, i see why
you've been avoiding me for months
but when you finally come out

all of my mouth
went about my body
detaches itself
from the ground
receives all of your love
and starts over
it is still here
all of my mouth
was about my body
cover me
i put my arms around your shoulders
and down my thighs
cover me
i put my arms around your shoulders
and down my thighs
cover me
i put my arms around your shoulders
say how you want
i see how i want
you get to choose
how you want to go
about your life
you're the one who said it
i don't have to explain
you have to make sense
you know what i'm up to
you just have to know

i can understand your worries
if your prayers were answered
i might well step out of line
and no one wants to listen to him
i can help by where i'm positioned
but no one wants to see me
and that's where i'm going
i'm giving you permission
now explain yourself
problem is, you say you love me
i see what i can do
now explain yourself
problem is, you say you love me
i see what i can do
now explain yourself
problem is, you say you love me
i see what i can do

perish, be strong

i can't take this surface

i can't take this surface

i can't accept full responsibility
i can't handle the consequences
i can't accept

i've seen it all and, if you ever get close to a human
and human behaviour
be ready, be ready to get confused
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic

but yet so, yet so irresistible
and there is no map
they're terribly, terribly, terribly moody
oh, human behaviour
then all of a sudden turn happy
but, oh, to get involved in the exchange
of human emotions
is ever so, ever so satisfying
and there is no map

while you are away
my heart comes undone
slowly unravels
in a ball of yarn
the devil collects it
with a grin
our love
in a ball of yarn
he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love
he'll never return it

bird species never seen or heard before
the first flute carved from the first fauna
utopia
it’s not elsewhere
let's purify
you assigned me to protect our lantern
to be intentional about the light
utopia
it isn't elsewhere
it’s here
my instinct has been shouting at me for years
saying, "let’s get out of here!"
huge toxic tumour bulging underneath the ground here
purify, purify, purify, purify toxicity

first snow of winter
i'm walking hills and valleys
adore this mystical fog!
this fucking mist!
these cliffs are just showing off!
then the body memory kicks in
i mime my home mountains
the moss that i'm made of
i redeem myself
i've been wrestling my fate
do i accept this ending?
will i accept my death
or struggle claustrophobic?
fought like a wolverine
with my destiny
refuse to accept what was meant to be
then the body memory kicks in
and i trust the unknown
unfathomable imagination
surrender to future
oh, how to capture all this love
and find a pathway for it
like threading an ocean through a needle
river through a keyhole
can't fathom the grasp
i can't grasp the fathom
then my body memory kicks in
my limbs and tongue take over
like the ancestors before me
show me the flow
my sexual dna
x-rays of my kama sutras
summons different bodies
compares spines and buttocks

====================
i have entered a state of trance
cleanse yourself
your lower lip limp
soft spotlessly happy
a new beginning

all bosoms sealed
crying 'cause i care
you're already broken
crying 'cause i care
i can feel you tight
crying 'cause i care
i can feel you tight
crying 'cause i care
let's break this curse
let's break this curse
so you don't repeat it
in a nest of leaves
he's gone hunting
he's gone hunting
he's gone hunting
he's going to steal our sun
and our bread
and our cakes
and our sweet dew
and our shelter
in a hidden place
in a hidden place

it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
sweethearts, sweethearts
i'm not taming no animal
and if one hopes
they're often met with
disasters like this
that, when they happen
make no noise about it
then all is well
you're all right
there's nothing wrong
you're all right
i'll be fine
just move along"

in pieces
my heart is so broken
i'm puzzling
here i go
trying to run ahead of that
heart-break-train
thinking
it will never catch up with me
i'm so broken

so broken

i'm trying to land
this aeroplane of ours gracefully
but it seems just destined to crash
i'm so broken
heðan-biður-afte-care
my heart is so broken

how can, how can
i sense all continuity just vanish away?
at one step at a time now baby

get over the sorrow, girl
the world is always going to be made of this
you can trust in it
unless you breathe in
bravely
i adore how you simply surrender to high
and your lungs, they're mourning
t-b style
all the stillborn love that could've happened
all the moments you should have embraced
all the moments you should have not locked up
understand so clearly:
to shut yourself up
would be the hugest crime of them all
hugest crime of them all
you're just crying after all
to not want them humans around
anymore
get over that sorrow, girl
get over it

hollow
my ancestors have access
hollow
i'm falling down the abyss
hollow
looking for some answers
generations of mothers sailing in
somehow they all were shipfolks
hollow
the ground is opening up
swallows me up
the trunk of dna
the trunk of dna, trunk
now come forth, all species
hollow
like a bead in necklace
thread me upon this chain
i'm part of it, ohh
the everlasting necklace
jewels after jewels after jewels after
jewels after jewels after jewels
i yearn to belong
let me belong
let me belong

up on the toe
there is a view
up on the toe
and the spine
straight and erect
hungry and curious
up on the toe
looking forward to
the air is thinner here
she came here
to lose face
got down on her knees
the beast is back!
on four legs
set her clock to the moon
raises her spine
vertebrae by vertebrae
up on the toe
looking
i have been filled with steam for months, for years
same old cloud, claustrophobic me
let it burst like old train sounds
make them leave me nature
vertebrae by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
my arms ooze out of my shoulders!
and the arms ooze out of my shoulders
i curl my tail inwards, inwards
i set my clock on the moon
vertebrae by vertebrae
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me

====================
I'll take care of you
protect you
calm, calm down
you're exhausted
you can't handle love
so don't make me say it
it will scare you off
it will scare you off
so don't make me say it
it will scare you off
it will scare you off
so don't make me say it
it will scare you off
it will scare you off
it will scare you off

you're trying too hard
surrender to change
it might not happen at all
if you give it time
it might happen now
and if it doesn't
you're just trying to make it right
i'm not stopping
you're trying too hard
restoring the brightness
it took me 13 years to get here
only you
could match
the brightness
i could get here
it would take me 13 years
to get here
just to make it easier on you
you are tryth
you are tryth

while you are away
my heart comes undone
slowly unravels
in a ball of yarn
the devil collects it
with a grin
our love

utopia
it’s not elsewhere
let's purify
you assigned me to protect our lantern
to be intentional about the light
utopia
it isn't elsewhere
it’s here
my instinct has been shouting at me for years
saying, "let’s get out of here!"
huge toxic tumour bulging underneath the ground here

first snow of winter
i'm walking hills and valleys
adore this mystical fog!
this fucking mist!
these cliffs are just showing off!
then the body memory kicks in
i mime my home mountains
the moss that i'm made of
i redeem myself
i've been wrestling my fate
do i accept this ending?
will i accept my death
or struggle claustrophobic?
fought like a wolverine
with my destiny
refuse to accept what was meant to be
then the body memory kicks in
oh, how i wish i were here
refuse to accept what was meant to be
then the body memory kicks in
oh, how i wish i were here
refuse to accept what was meant to be
oh, how i wish i were here
now i wish i were here
i wish i were here
oh, how i wish i were here
i wish i were here

here i'm not heard
stirring at water's edge
my mind in frenzy

swirling my purse around

hey, hey, hey
i'm a fountain of blood
in the shape of a girl
you're the bird on the brim
hypnotised by the whirl
drink me, make me feel real
wet your beak in the stream
game we're playing is life
love's a two way dream
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a path of cinders
burning under your feet
you're the one who walks me
i'm your one way street
i'm a whisper in the water
secret for you to hear
you're the one who grows distant
when i beckon you near
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a tree that grows hearts
one for each that you take
you're the intruder's hand
i'm the branch that you break

my healed chest wound
transformed into a gate
where i receive love from
where i give love from
and i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
split into many parts
splattered light beams into prisms
that will reunite
if you care for me, care for me
if you care for me, care for me
care for me, care for me
and then i'll care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
didn't used to be so needy
just more broken than normal
proud self-sufficiency
my silhouette is oval
it is a gate
i can care for you, care for you from
i can care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
you care for me, care for me
care for you

you can't say no to hope
can't say no to happiness
it's summer!"
don't say no to hope
it's summer

summons, beckons, greets
every memory
is just there to keep you going
see, see
there is a swarm of sound
around our heads
and we can hear it
and think about it
how we will make it right
every memory
is just there to keep you going

i can't get no
thank you
to be able to go out
of my way
to make you a musical
the more space i give to sound

it's almost time
i've been tucked away
there is no-one around
and there is a warning
tale all over town
that i cannot see
and that is why
i mustn't fall into it
it's coming up
there's a man in a treehouse
that you can trust
and he he says he'll take me in his arms
he takes my blood, his beard
warm and personal
and then returns it
taking me in his arms
he holds me in his arms
tell me what you think

once you fell out of love
our love couldn't carry you
and i didn't even notice
for our love kept me safe from death
you doubted the light
and the shelter it can give
for in love we are immortal
eternal and safe from death
if i regret us
i'm denying my soul to grow
don't remove my pain
it is my chance to heal
we carry the same wound
but have different cures
similar injuries
but opposite remedies
after our love ended
your arms don't carry me
without love i feel the abyss
understand your fear of death
i will not forget
this notget
will you not regret
having love let go?
after our love ended
your spirit entered me
now we are the guardians
we'll keep her safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
safe, safe from...
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death

if you ever get close to a human
and human behaviour
be ready, be ready to get confused
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
to human behaviour
but yet so, yet so irresistible
and there is no map
they're terribly, terribly, terribly moody
oh, human behaviour
then all of a sudden turn happy
but, oh, to get involved in the exchange
of human emotions

and there is no map
human behaviour, human, human
human behaviour, human, human

human behaviour, human, human

====================
looking forward to
the air is thinner here
skin is warmer there
warm pockets are underbelly
this chest tunnel has opened
for you, me, me
who do you think saved you?
who do you think saved you?
who do you think saved you?
i consigned myself
to this solitude
to resist intrusion
rescue you
from yourself
and the world to forget
how you overcome
your fear of forgetting
it will take courage to forget

up to now i've only met up with one
 person
to my surprise
i've never met aeurysm
and that wasn't even close
you couldn't even jump
and walk upright
and not have a mouth to feed
i couldn't even speak
and i felt you suck
the warmth of fear
and the fear of
entering the universe without a care
and the universe without a care
just another fear
i've seen and i know you'll see me
i haven't met you yet
so special
but only if
a meteorites crash
or a volcano erupt
and kill all that is in it
and leave me be
i'm a new world, new day to see
new continents to explore
and if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i'll let you in
i'm a new world, i'm a new day to see
new continents to explore
and if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i'm a minute into this new world
and i can feel it
touching my bones
and growing
and the palms of the hands
i can't say no more
to any happiness
this way
it will be over before it
when i'm done
i can't say no more
to any happiness
this way
it will be over before it
when i'm done
i can't say no more
to any happiness
this way
it will be over before it
when i'm done
i can't say no more
to any
satisfaction
here
to be
in sufficient numbers
to be able
to take the risk
to go where no one has gone
and see what's going on
there
i'm sure there are those in particular
who say, 'cause when i grow up
i want to
be there with them
and see what's going on
there
i'm sure there are those in particular
who say, 'cause when i grow up
when i'm little
there was no one to help me
and people always say, 'cause when i grow up
when i'm five or six
years removed
from the crash
where the beast it is
i'm back!
seven speed
gorgeous!

is to fail miserably
fail at loving and fail at giving
fail at creating a flow
then realign the whole

not 'til it shimmers 'round your skull
i'll be yours
i weave for you
the marvellous web

all neon like
the cocoon surrounds you
embraces all
so you can sleep
foetus-style

i have walked this earth
and watched people
it doesn't scare me at all
i can be sincere
and say i like them
it doesn't scare me at all
you can't say no to hope
can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
i want to go on a mountain top
with a radio and good batteries
and play a joyous tune and
free the human race
from suffering
it doesn't scare me at all
i'm no fucking buddhist
but this is enlightenment
the less room you give me
the more space i've got
it doesn't scare me at all
you can't say no to hope
can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
i want to be on a mountain top
with a radio and good batteries
and play a joyous tune and
free the human race
from suffering
it doesn't scare me at all
this is an alarm-call
so wake up, wake up now
today has never happened
and it doesn't frighten me
it doesn't scare me at all
you can't say no to hope
you can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all

i wish i want to stay here
i wish this be enough
i wish i only love you
i wish simplicity
look at the speed out there
it magnetizes me to it
and i have no fear
i'm only into this to
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
i wish i'd only look
and didn't have to touch
i wish i'd only smell this
and didn't have to taste
how can i ignore?
this is sex without touching
i'm going to explore
i'm only into this to
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy

i will wade out till my thighs
are steeped in burning flowers
i will take the sun in my mouth
and leap into the ripe air alive
with closed eyes
to dash against darkness
in the sleeping curves of my body
i shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
with chasteness of seagirls
will i complete the mystery of my flesh?
will i complete the mystery of my flesh, my flesh?

i walk through this land
stake a claim
with my sense
with my bark
mark my nest with song
hear the, the echo, echo from that cliff
i draw laser line through lake
to take physicality
i inhale this physicality
this forest is in me
this forest is in me
i immerse me
this is my home

i love your eyes, my dear
their splendid, sparkling fire

the nerves are sending shimmering signals
all through my fingers
the veins support
blood that gushes impulsively towards
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the stubborn trunks of these legs of mine
serve as pathways for my favourite fuel
heading upwards towards my kidneys
that celebrate
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
smooth soft red velvety lungs
are pushing a network of oxygen joyfully
through a nose, through a mouth
but all enjoys, all enjoys
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart

it's tricky when
you feel someone
has done something
on your behalf
it's slippery when
your sense of justice
murmurs underneath
and is asking you:
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
with a palm full of stars
i throw them like dice repeatedly
on the table repeat, repeatedly
i shake them like dice
and throw them on the table
repeatedly repeatedly
until the desired constellation appears
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
and you hear: how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?

her bewitching little girl

new technologies are creating exciting new opportunities
i feel at home

with every step
they draw me in
they strengthen me
this is a new world

i'm walking on air
this is humidity
i'm burning off layers
this is what i get for having free will
i release all the negatives
i've been suppressing
i release all the positives
i wish to flow
this is freedom

it's a hot day and i'm dressed lightly

come on, girl
let's sneak out of this party
it's getting boring
there's more to life than this
it's still early morning
we could go down to the harbor
and jump between the boats
and see the sun come up
you know that there's more to life than this?
you know that there's more to life?

two totally miss each other
you broke off a chain of relationships
most famously your love triangle
but after five decades of apart
things finally got a little heated
and then it got a little ugly
you both were victims of your own imagination
but after five decades of apart
you've got a vision that is brighter than anyone
and fulfills me with hope
get over it, dear
you're both virtual disasters
come clean, take care
there is always someone out there
who i can take care of
and if you complain once more
you'll take the blame
you just didn't know who to be
and then there'd be no presents for
oh, no, no!

my yearning has been broken
and the clock is ringing
no courage for love, for love
no courage for love
let's open up
let this be a day
a place to stay
for all of you
who said you were 'off my radar'
did you understand?
the home you've always called home
home you've never seen?
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
oh i
you

on a warm evening in the southern city
black night is falling
the sun is gone to bed
the innocent are dreaming
wolves of old times
stirring at night in the dark
the words they kept
innocence defiantly refusing to let you go
they whirl around me and they grow a beard for me
na na na, na na na
na na na, na na
na na na, na na
in a tower of steel
nature forges a deal
to raise wonderful hell for me
in a place called hell
the bravest of climbers
thrilling the charts
oh thou that bowest
thy dance is complete
it is an age old struggle
the earth rises and falls
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
oh i
you
you

on a cold night
the strong lights
the lullaby of the fairies
garbled softly by the theviet nymphs
winds through the leaves and stars and smells of spring
oh i
you
you

on a hot day
the gentle reverie
of the parrots
ohhhhh!
they're dancing!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
oaaahh!!!

oh, oh
darling, stop confusing me
with your wishful thinking
hopeful embraces
don't you understand?
i have to go through this
i belong to here where
no one cares, and no one loves
no light no air to live in
a place called hate
the city of fear
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
and the hurt stops
it's sometimes just like sleeping
curling up inside my private tortures
i nestle into pain
hug suffering
caress every ache
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting

like a virus needs a body
as soft tissue feeds on blood
some day i'll find you, the urge is here
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
like a mushroom on a tree trunk
as the protein transmutates
i knock on your skin, and i am in
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
the perfect match, you and me
i adapt, contagious
you open up, say welcome
like a flame that seeks explosives
as gunpowder needs a war
i feast inside you, my host is you
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
the perfect match, you and i
you fail to resist
my crystalline charm
like a virus, patient hunter
i'm waiting for you, i'm starving for you
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
my sweet adversary, ooh
my sweet adversary, oh
my sweet adversary
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh

lately
i find myself out gazing at stars
hearing guitars
like someone in love
sometimes the things i do astound me
mostly whenever you're around me
lately
i seem to walk as though i have wings
bump into things
like someone in love
each time i look at you, i'm limp as a glove
and feeling like someone in love
sometimes the things i do astound me
mostly whenever you're around me
lately
i seem to walk as though i have wings
bump into things
like someone in love
each time i look at you, i'm limp as a glove
and feeling like someone in love
like someone in love
like someone in love

underneath our feet
crystals grow like plants
listen how they grow
i'm blinded by the lights
listen how they grow
in the core of the earth
listen how they glow
crystalline
internal nebula
cry
====================
hollow
hollow
the ground is opening up
swallows me up
the trunk of dna
the trunk of dna, trunk
now come forth, all species
hollow
like a bead in necklace
thread me upon this chain
i'm part of it, ohh
the everlasting necklace
jewels after jewels after jewels after
jewels after jewels after jewels
i yearn to belong
let me belong
let me belong
let me belong

up on the toe
there is a view
up on the toe
and the spine
straight and erect
hungry and curious
up on the toe
looking forward to
the air is thinner here
she came here
to lose face
got down on her knees
the beast is back!
on four legs
set her clock to the moon
raises her spine
vertebrae by vertebrae
up on the toe
looking
i have been filled with steam for months, for years
same old cloud, claustrophobic me
let it burst like old train sounds
make them leave me nature
vertebrae by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
my arms ooze out of my shoulders!
and the arms ooze out of my shoulders
i curl my tail inwards, inwards
i set my clock on the moon
vertebrae by vertebrae
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
let off some steam

nature has fixed no limits on our hopes
oh, what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if her bump was fake or if it was real?
here's my version of it
eternal whirlwind

genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
so warm
sounds go through the muscles
these abstract, wordless movements
move, move, move, move, move
they start off cells that haven't been touched before
these cells are virgins
waking up slowly waking up
waking up slowly wake up
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
nothing will be the same
i'm asleep
i'm fast asleep
i like this resonance
it elevates me
i don't recognise myself
this is very interesting
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
i'm fast asleep now
you're still with me
i'm fast asleep
i'm asleep
my headphones
they saved, saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

i shuffle around the tectonic plates in my chest
you know i gave it all
try to match our continents
to change seasonal shift
to form a mutual core
as fast as your fingernail grows
the atlantic ridge drifts
to counteract distance
you know i gave it all
can you hear the effort
of the magnetic strife?
shuffling of columns
to form a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
you hid the key to our continuity
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know
what you resist persists
nuance makes heat
to counteract distance
i know you gave it all
offered me harmony
if things were done your way
my eurasian plate subsumed
forming a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know i had it in me
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know



his embrace, a fortress
it fuels me and places
a skeleton of trust
right beneath us
bone by bone
stone by stone
if you ask yourself patiently and carefully:
who is it? who is it?
who is it that never lets
====================
i love that you care
that you care
that you care

from a boy's fountain to a boy's
he holds out alone
and fears big
and small
i can't get no... support
let's get going
get some form of organised support
this ain't right
i'm alone
and don't get upset
the thing is, it's always going to be
there's always going to be
somehow i'm not around to support
and i don't know what to do with my life
admiring?
burning?
simply relaxing
in a ball
with the boys
this ain't right
i'm alone
and don't get angry

to create a sense of community?
there's always going to be
there's always going to be
there's always going to be
there's always going to be
there's not much left to do
where is the line with you?
how is a maple shaped?
like a key
i cut a heart
and carvings it's history
oh, how i love it when you touch it
and then you throw it on the table
oh, refinished cherry blossom
oh, undamaged oval lake
it floats in my hands
and sinks into the water
oh, to the left of it
oh, to the left of it
what's the lesser of two evils

here's my version of it
eternal whirlwind
i have fostered since childhood
well, i don't care
love is all
i dare to drown
to be proven wrong

when your eyes pause on the ball
that hangs on the third branch from the star
you remember why it is dark
and why it gets light again
the earth, like the heart, slopes in its seat
and, like that, it travels along an elliptical path
drawn into the darkness
an unpolished pearl
in sky-black palm of hand
flickering sun-flame
and then you remember
that you, yourself, you are a light-bearer, a light-bearer
receiving radiance from others
flickering sun-flame
unpolished earth in palm of hand

show me forgiveness
for having lost faith in myself
and let my own interior up
to inferior forces
the shame is endless
but if soon start forgiveness
the girl might live

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
i see who you are
i see who you.... are...

it may not always be so
and i say that if your lips
which i have loved
should touch another's
and your dear strong fingers clutch her heart
as mine in time not far away

====================
my heart is so broken
i'm puzzling
here i go
trying to find an answer

are as important as the injuries
they're still being torn up
palliative care: wake up, wake up

should touch another's

as mine in time not far away
if on another's face your sweet hair lay
in such a silence as i know
or such great writhing words as, uttering overmuch
stand helplessly before the spirit at bay
if this should be, i say if this should be
you of my heart, send me a little word
that i may go unto her, and take her hands saying
accept all happiness from me
then i shall turn my face
and hear one bird sing terribly afar in the lost lands

====================
i only listen to what she has to say
and do them slowly
soothe me
protect me
drown my sorrows
love will always overcome us
justice will always be our dream
show some emotion
do some walking
and others lying
dull tears of relief
when i saw her end
i remember well
the world is never boring
nothing is ever real
happy, sustainable, in control
and tears in the sky above

train-whistles, a sweet clementine

if living is seeing
i'm holding my breath
in wonder - i wonder
what happens next?
a new world, a new day to see
see, see
i'm softly walking on air
halfway to heaven from here
sunlight unfolds in my hair
oh - i'm walking on air
oh - to heaven from here
oh
if living is seeing
i'm holding my breath
in wonder - i wonder
what happens next?
a new world, a new day to see

he means tomorrow but says, "in a bit"
and doesn't show up at all
he sets his watch to a comet's orbit
and remembers to forget to call
no courage for love, too scared to be happy
no courage for love, too scared to be happy
i do, do
i do, do
"your place or mine?" means "heaven or hell?"
two addresses somewhat apart
his home's dark and spiky, her's clear as a bell
it's over before they can start
no courage for love, too scared to be happy
no courage for love, too scared to be happy
i do, don't
i do, don't
and tomorrow passed them by
and tomorrow passed them by

he's starving to death, oh
immortal
the ground is opening up
swallows me up
the trunk of dna
the trunk of dna, trunk
now come forth, all species
hollow
like a bead in necklace
thread me upon this chain
i'm part of it, ohh
the everlasting necklace
jewels after jewels after jewels after
jewels after jewels after jewels
i yearn to belong
let me belong
let me belong

up on the toe
there is a view
up on the toe
and the spine
straight and erect
hungry and curious
up on the toe
looking forward to
the air is thinner here
she came here
to lose face
got down on her knees
the beast is back!
on four legs
set her clock to the moon
raises her spine
vertebrae by vertebrae
up on the toe
looking
i have been filled with steam for months, for years
same old cloud, claustrophobic me
let it burst like old train sounds
make them leave me nature
vertebrae by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
my arms ooze out of my shoulders!
and the arms ooze out of my shoulders
i curl my tail inwards, inwards
i set my clock on the moon
vertebrae by vertebrae
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
let off some steam

here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind

what's the lesser of two evils
if a suicide bomber made to look pregnant
manages to kill her target or not?
what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if she kills them or dies in vain?
nature has fixed no limits on our hopes
oh, what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if her bump was fake or if it was real?
here's my version of it
eternal whirlwind
i have fostered since childhood
well, i don't care
love is all
i dare to drown
to be proven wrong

when your eyes pause on the ball
that hangs on the third branch from the star
you remember why it is dark
and why it gets light again
the earth, like the heart, slopes in its seat
and, like that, it travels along an elliptical path
drawn into the darkness
an unpolished pearl
in sky-black palm of hand
flickering sun-flame
and then you remember
that you, yourself, you are a light-bearer, a light-bearer
receiving radiance from others
flickering sun-flame
unpolished earth in palm of hand

show me forgiveness
for having lost faith in myself
and let my own interior up
to inferior forces
the shame is endless
but if soon start forgiveness
the girl might live

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
i see who you are
i see who you.... are...

it may not always be so
and i say that if your lips
which i have loved
should touch another's
and your dear strong fingers clutch her heart
as mine in time not far away
if on another's face your sweet hair lay
in such a silence as i know
or such great writhing words as, uttering overmuch
stand helplessly before the spirit at bay
if this should be, i say if this should be
you of my heart, send me a little word
that i may go unto her, and take her hands saying
accept all happiness from me
then i shall turn my face
and hear one bird sing terribly afar in the lost lands

when will it be time to document?
do it now!
this submarine behaviour

when time?
do it now!
to return

my warm little love
i'm trying to get
things just right
but the gears are turning
and the intention clear
but the intentions are still raw
if you ever get close to a human
and human behaviour
be ready, be ready to get confused
there's plenty to discover
and there's baiting in store
you'll meet a human eye
but you'll need a laser
to catch the light
and if you wish
you'll need to travel far

i can't think of a way to live

adore this mystical fog!
this fucking mist!
these cliffs are just showing off!

i mime my home mountains
the moss that i'm made of

i've been wrestling my fate
do i accept this ending?
will i accept my death
or struggle claustrophobic?
fought like a wolverine
with my destiny
refuse to accept what was meant to be
then the body memory kicks in
and i trust the unknown

and feeling like someone in love

bump into things

with our feet marching
grinding skeptics

shower of goodness coming to
end the doubt pouring over
shower of goodness coming to end
we are the earth intruders

i have guided my bones through some voltage
and love them still
and love them too
metallic!

what is to do but dig
dig bones out of earth
mud graves!

here come the earth intruders
there'll be no resistance
we are the canoneerers

heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me, make me wonder
they say back then our universe was an empty sea
until a silver fox and her cunning mate
began to sing a song that became the world we know
heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me, make me wonder
and they say back then our universe was a cold black egg
until the god inside burst out and from its shattered shell
he made what became the world we know
heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me, make me wonder
and they say back then our universe was an endless land
until our ancestors woke up and before they went back to sleep
they carved it all into the world we know
heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me, make me wonder
and they say back then our universe wasn’t even there
until a sudden bang and then there was light, was sound, was matter
and it all became the world we know
heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me and dance eternal

i am strong in his hands, i am beyond me
on my own, i am human, and i do faults
i do confess, i feel you trickling
down my shoulders from above
i turn myself in, i give myself up
volunteer, you own me i'm yours
you have to trust it, i'm eternally yours
all that i gave them, i gave to you
so needy of comfort, but too raw to be embraced
undo this privacy and put me in my place
generous palmstroke: the hugest of hugs
undo this privacy, embrace
embrace me
embrace me
embrace me
em-
i am strong in his hands, i am above
way beyond me, i can't...
she's strong in his hands, she is beyond her
on her own, she is human, and she does faults
she's strong in his hands, she is beyond her
on her own, she is human, and she does faults

the pleasure is all mine
to get to be the generous one
is the strongest stance
the pleasure is all mine
to finally let go
and evenly flow
who gives most
who gives most
who gives most
the pleasure is all mine
women like us
we strengthen most
host-like
when in doubt: give
when in doubt: give

i love your eyes, my dear
their splendid sparkling fire
when suddenly you raise them so
to cast a swift embracing glance
like lightning flashing in the sky
but there's a charm that is greater still:
when my love's eyes are lowered
when all is fired by passions kiss
and through the downcast lashes
i see the dull flame of desire
and through the downcast lashes
i see the dull flame of desire
i love your eyes,

you are gonna have to find out for yourself

train-whistles, a sweet clementine
blueberries, dancers in line
cobwebs, a bakery sign
oh - a sweet clementine
oh - dancers in line
oh
if living is seeing
i'm holding my breath
in wonder - i wonder
what happens next?
a new world, a new day to see
see, see
i'm softly walking on air
halfway to heaven from here
sunlight unfolds in my hair
oh - i'm walking on air
oh - to heaven from here
oh
if living is seeing
i'm holding my breath
in wonder - i wonder
what happens next?
a new world, a new day to see

he means tomorrow but says, "in a bit"
and doesn't show up at all
he sets his watch to a comet's orbit
and remembers to forget to call
no courage for love, too scared to be happy
no courage for love, too scared to be happy
i do, do
i do, do
"your place or mine?" means "heaven or hell?"
two addresses somewhat apart
his home's dark and spiky, her's clear as a bell
it's over before they can start
no courage for love, too scared to be happy
no courage for love, too scared to be happy
i do, don't

all the effort you put into creating this website
you've saved up for the weekend
you're still with the same girl
i got lazy and decided to ogle the most perfect clementines
i've been sucking them for dear life
drink me now, make me feel real
you've saved up for the weekend
i'm still with the same guy

i remember you
you're the one that said, "i love you too

====================
example
fear is a powerful drug
overcome it and
you think that you can do
anything
should i
save myself
for later
or generously give?
fear of
losing
energy
is draining
it locks up your chest
shuts down the heart
miserly
and stingy
let's open up: share!
when i once was
fearless
innocence roared
still amazes
untouchable
innocence
it is still here
and i can feel
universal love
and that is unconditional
ugly mass
i feel your hands
miserly
and stingy
miserly
and stingy
let's share this ugly darkness
unexplained light
in the darkness
i'll stay in this ugly darkness
and be love forever
explain to yourself
how i got here
how i healed
this scar
is a gate
for the love of
overemotional
overemotional
overemotional help open
up
overemotional
overemotional angle
around the mouth
and the nose
and the neck
and the mouth
overemotional

we are all still inside
after our rescue mission
overemotional
the room is turning ugly
i wonder if someone out there
will look at me and say
how can anyone be hurt?
you've seen me before
and someone was hurt
and someone was hurt
it's not over before they get hurt
someone's name is wrong
and they're hiding in the bushes
he's trying to sneak out
somehow they got here
they're sneaking out
it's not up to you
you're supposed to be paranoid
i'm not hurting them much
i'm hiding from you
it's not up to you
you're supposed to be paranoid
i'm not hurting them much
i'm trying to sneak out
i'm trying to sneak out
i really don't want anyone else
understandings are, they get mixed up
and they're trying to sneak out
i'm giving them directions
and they're seeming confused
i'm trying to sneak out
i'm hiding from you
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
to them saying hey
i'm sorry i dumped you out
but there's no way out
there's a roof over my head
and a view to the sky
silly solomon
but there's no way out
silly solomon
silly solomon
silly solomon
i'll stay in this ugly darkness
underneath our feet
i'm going down with my friends
i'm going down with my friends
i'm going down with my friends
it's not up to you
i'm not hurt
it's not up to you
i'm nothin' about it
it's not up to you
oh i

if living is seeing
it would be a massacre
not to be believed
but imagine what it would be like
a suicide bomber
smashing into buildings
all in the name of Islam

you are the one to blame
you were the one to blame
you were the one to blame
you were the one to blame
i offer our prayers as our cross
to him who saved us
you were the one to blame
you were the one to blame
you were the one to blame
i offer our prayers as our cross
cross our hearts as we mourn
we remember you
we remember you
you are the ray through which i see
all that is bright
is all that is gone
you are the lightning through which i see
all that is cold
is all that is warm
you are the spark that i share
with my child
who grew up with you
and will always be
i am meant to be
but i found out the hard way
it was all worth it
i didn't write it down
it's all there on the table
it reads what i have to say
all that is bright
is all that is gone
you are the lightning through which i see
all that is cold
is all that is warm
you are the spark that i share
with my child
who grew up with you
and will always be
i am meant to be
but i found out the hard way
it was all for it
it was all for it
all that was right
was all that was needed
all that was right
was all that was needed
for it to be over before it could happen
it would have been a disaster
not here, not here
not here, not here
not here, not here
i would not be here
to facilitate it
but would be dereliction
i should be arrested
for

is a cross between a boy and a girl
traveling around the world
my heart is so broken
i'm going to Ibiza
to meet people
this is really dangerous
but worth all the effort
if you get hurt
you're going to meet a killer
and i'm going to nurse him
and they're going to be his friends
i'm not trying to hurt you
i'm trying to help you
so use your imagination, darling
how you up-close
your image of me
up-and-comer
your image of me
up-and-comer
you're trying too hard
to prove a point
you're not just another critic
you're trying too hard
he's trying too hard
to prove a point
you're the one who's trying, you're trying
you're the one who's lying
you know that there's truth in all of this
you know that there's bravo
to be honest
i really don't care
you can't say no to hope
i know that there's justice in all of this
justice for me, if you complain
you'll be arrested
for your vocal dissent
and there's always someone
to catch me
there's always someone to catch me
there's always someone to catch me
there's always someone to catch me
when you complain
you're arrested

where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?

my purse wide open
you ask again
i see the crime and
cash into accounts everywhere
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
i want to be flexible
i want to go out
of my way for you
but enough is enough
where is the line with you?

i can not live
peacefully without you
for even a moment
i miss you terribly
when you're away
he's away
this ain't right
i'm alone
i'm taking an aeroplane
across the world
to follow my heart
how come out of all the people in the world
only one can make me complete?
one word, one word on the phone
makes me happy
one touch, but one touch directly
makes me ecstatic
he's away
this ain't right
i'm alone
i'm taking an aeroplane
across the world
to follow my heart

why can't you give her room?
respect her spatial needs
i feel you compress her
into a small space
with clairvoyance
she knew what you needed
and she gave it to you
now her desires are repressed
arrows in the flesh
when she, when she found your love
her nature bowed her head
she surrendered
she renounced the world for you
now she’s poisoned by demands
you cannot answer
why this sacrifice?
now she regrets the whole thing
a delayed reaction
when she left her craft voluntarily
for your nest, for your love
did you understand?
appreciate
build a bridge to her
initiate a touch
before it’s too late
say the words to her
that will make her shine
tell her that you love her
your generosity will show
in the volume of her glow
your generosity will show
in the volume of her glow
your generosity will show
in

it's warm in the ass of your thighs
warm in the palm of your hand
warm in the palm of your hand
who is open?
and who has shut up
and if one feels closed
how does one stay open?
we have emotional needs, oh needs, oh needs, oh ooh
i wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, our ooh
oh, show some emotional respect, oh respect, oh ooh
a juxtapositioning fate
find our mutual coordinates

we live on a mountain
right at the top
there's a beautiful view
from the top of the mountain
every morning i walk towards the edge
and throw little things off
like cars and bread slacks
or whatever i find lying around
it's become a habit
a way to start the day
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
it's early morning
no one is awake
i'm back at my cliff
still throwing things off
i listen to the sounds they make
on their way down
i follow with my eyes till they crash
i imagine what my body would sound like
slamming against those rocks
and when it lands
will my eyes be closed or open?
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you

all these accidents that happen
follow the dot
coincidence makes sense
only with you
you don't have to speak

emotional landscapes

and you push me up to
this state of emergency
how beautiful to be
state of emergency
is where i want to be
all that no one sees

every nerve that hurts

maybe he will come out of this
maybe he won't
somehow i'm not too bothered either way
maybe he will come out of this loving me
maybe he will come out of this
i smell declarations of solitude
maybe he will come out of this
vietnam vet comes after the war
lands in my house
this wild lion doesn't fit in this chair
maybe he will come out of this loving me
maybe he won't
i'm not taming no animal
maybe he will come out of this
once it was simple
one feeling at a time
it reached its peak then transformed
these abstract complex feelings
i just don't know how to handle them
should i throw oil on one of these moods
but which one?
the joy peak
humor peak
frustration peak
anything peak
for clarity
maybe he will come out of this loving me
maybe he won't
i'm not taming no animal
maybe he will come out of this
maybe he will come out of this
maybe he won't
somehow i'm not too bothered either way
somehow i'm not too bothered either way
i refuse, it's a sign of maturity
to be stuck in complexity
i demand all clarity
maybe he will come out of this
or he
====================
there is yet another one
that follows me
wherever i go
and supports me
all this tooth is warmth-like
it's all there in me
all that you gave me
was all there in you
all that you gave me
is all there in me
all that you gave me
is all there in me
all that you gave me
is all there in me
you gave me strength to share
it was this warmth that made me want to raze
every tree that was alive that day
had a heart that cared for its dying host
and a heart that looked forward to the day when it all will be decided
and the day that i want to be
not far off, far away
in the distance
i can feel you prance about
all was right about one day
but right now
it's a bit blurry
and the horizon doesn't seem to move
and the aurora is up in the sky
and the comet is out of the picture
all that you said was true
you saw what you had and got to do
and after a while you would just be wandering
about town
fearless wandering
admiring a musical on my car
sending each others mp3s
phil and i would song each other these songs
ambassador of harmony
falling in love to song
i became one with harmony
dovetail of patience
surefoot of ground
sure foot of himt
carefully shaping me
heating the heart by tree
warming it by foot
it's a rhythm that gets broken often
a song that you've been listening to for hours
sounds and forces change slightly
sometimes they do
sometimes they don't
i stop listening
and analyze
all that i ever wanted
was at stake
this is the beginning of it all
the end of it all
if i don't get what i've been through
then i go through it
it will be eternal
i can't get what i've been through
it will be over before it is
if i don't get what i've been given
then i'm not even close to getting it
and if i don't get it then the end of all things
and if i don't get what i've been given
then all will be decided by now
and you will notice
that there is much to be desired
and that all will be well
if there is ever a time traveller
who remembers the past
and knows all that is said and done
then please remember to follow my lead
and remember to follow my lead
if you are lost
and if you are found
where is the line with you?
and the icon lights up
always the icon lights up
always the icon lights up
always the icon lights up
always the icon lights up
i remember
now," stop confusing me!"
with all the help i can give
i remember, and i give all the time i can give
to give you the strongest possible version of my face
face the darkest shade of a tree
the skin soft and soft as a baby
oh - i share this pain
we're almost there - get ready for some huge laughs
and the megaphone goes boom
oh, boom! - the megaphone goes boom
big laugh, big laugh!
oh, hi - i'm Dylan - hi - i'm here to defend
yeah, hi - it's me - it's me - it's me
yeah, hi - it's me - it's me
i've been naughty a few people have been nice
you're trying too hard
silly things are going around

silly things are going around
i'm trying to get something out of it
silly things are going around
there's too much sugar in cakes
i'm trying to get something out of it
silly things are going around
there's too much sugar in cakes

a pleasure to be had
here's the deal - i'll give you something

they scare
====================
this is a touching moment
when i was younger
when i first met you
i was just shy
tiny – shy
but by the time i met you
i was already so
what's the lesser of two evils?
who will give you the most love?
i want to be you
you're still inside me
sweetly
i want to be you
you're inside me, baby
every bit of you
is yours
not mine, but yours
you're already inside me
oh, you
you
you

while i crawl into the unknown
cover me
i'm going hunting for mysteries

i'm going to prove the impossible exists
this is really dangerous
cover me
but worth all the effort
cover me
i'm going to prove the impossible really exists

and these teeth are a ladder up to his mouth
all these teeth are a ladder that i walk
that you can walk too if you want
if you want up to the mouth
the mouth's cradle
up to the mouth's cradle
he always has a hope for me
always sees me when nothing else
and everyone have left
that ghost is brighter than anyone
and fulfills me with hope
those beams assure me
and you can use these teeth as a ladder
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
and you can follow these notes i'm singing
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
the simplicity of the ghost-like beast
the purity of what it wants and where it goes
always love, always loves you, always loves you
infrared love
and you can use those teeth as a ladder
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
and you can use those teeth, oh, follow my voice
tooth by tooth
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle

i once had no fears
none at all

i had some
to my surprise
i grew to like both
scared or brave
without them
the thrill of fear
thought i'd never admit it
the thrill of fear
now greatly enjoyed with courage
when i once was
untouchable
innocence roared
still amazes
when i once was
innocent
it is still here
but in different places
neurosis
only
attaches
itself to
fertile
ground
where it can flourish

this is an alarm-call game
i'll speak to a lady in the city
she'll tell me what's going on
in her community, in her life
and the solutions she offers
i'm not even close
so close
yet
if you ask her often
the day goes by that you die
you know the feelings that i have
i refuse to let happen
you refuse to let go
and if you ask her often
the night falls
i go to sleep easy-going
relentless
lovesick by night
the muscles of commitment
move slowly, slowly, slowly
not to sound arrogant
but do I sound arrogant?
to be totally clear
i don't believe you
i don't believe you
move slowly, slowly, slowly
not to sound arrogant
but do I sound arrogant?
to be totally clear
i don't believe you
i don't believe you
move slowly, slowly, slowly
not to sound arrogant
but do i sound arrogant?
to be totally clear
i don't believe you
i don't believe you
move slowly, slowly, slowly
not to sound arrogant
but do i sound arrogant?
to be totally clear
i don't believe you
i don't believe you

his wicked sense of humour
suggests exciting sex
his fingers, they focus on her
touches, he's venus asaboy
he believes ina beauty
he's venus as a boy
hebelieves in a beauty
he's exploring the taste of her
arousal, so accurate
he sets off the beauty in her
he's venus, venus as a boy
he believes in a beauty

====================
we have fallen from your generous hands
and are struggling to breathe
we need a bed
the pleasure of childbirth
a desk made of birch bark
a copy of Sacred Heart
i code my love for you
your obsessions are distracting me
but the truth is, i love you
most hearts fear their own home
and they imagine a world without you
only to have their own heart
focused only on the moment
anger is the mother's hope
most hearts fear their own home
and they imagine a world without you
only to have their own heart
focused only on the moment
suffering is the mother's hope
most hearts fear their own home
and they imagine a world without you
only to have their own heart

i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is where i'm staying
this is my home
i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is where i'm staying
down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is where i'm staying

once again
alien in nature
sometimes people feel trapped
and they seem to
be falling down the abyss
the power of will
which made me them fall
what made you all fall
first contact
nature is ever present
and when we share it
our tongues warm at the mouth
and we tongues heal
the fingers of bondage
the fingers of bondage
lulled me up

so broken
in pieces
my heart is so broken
i'm puzzling
here i go
trying to run ahead of that
heart-break-train
thinking
it will never catch up with me
i'm so broken
heðan-biður-afte-care
so broken
heðan-biður-afte-care
yeah, ha-ee, ha-ee, ha-mmm
heðan-biður
i'm trying to land
this aeroplane of ours gracefully
but it seems just destined to crash
i'm so broken
heðan-biður-afte-care
my heart is so broken
heðan-biður-afte-care
how can, how can
i sense all continuity just vanish away?
at one step at a time now baby
i'm so broken
heðan-liður-afte-care
i'm so broken
heðan-biður-afte-care
i'm so
completely unhealable, baby

it's dark out and i'm asleep
i'm trying to make it right
it's dark out and i'm lying
cover me
i'm going hunting for mysteries
cover me
sending them love notes
i'm just doing my best
cover me
cover me
so what's the use, cover me
cover me
sending them love notes
i'm just doing my best
cover me
cover me
this is it, this is it, this is it
all of my body
in a bed of potholes
in a mountain range
in the south-eastern hemisphere
in the southern hemisphere
i go through
it carefully
it is not meant to be a struggle uphill
yeah, i know
yeah, i know
yeah, i know
isn't meant to be a strife
yeah, i know
yeah, i know
yeah, i know
one last tug of war
between us
isn't meant to be a war of attrition
yeah, i know
yeah, i know
yeah, i know
once again
open
and share this load
it's become a habit
a way to start the day
it's become a habit
a way to end the day
it's become a mutual habit
a mutual habit
it's become a habit
to start off the day
i'll be slumberless
i'm a walking monument
the bugs never leave me
not for a moment's reflection
it's not meant to be as boring as this
it's not meant to be a romance
it's not meant to be a honeymoon
i'm going to be rich and strong
and work as many nimble presses as you possibly can
and keep me flowing money
like a virus needs a body
loaded with ingredients
i'm going to develop a taste for life
dangerous amounts of THC
one by one, i become more and more attracted
i conquer claustrophobia
no, i conquer claustrophobia
trapped in a tree trunk
foraging for aphrodisiac
saying, "hey, hey, hey"
all the love above
is just another form of transportation
passengers passes at night
all is not meant to be as empty as this
no, i would not do that
with my life on the line
stirring at water's edge
negative emotions resurface
i surfed your fears
narcissistic
and legal
the truth is, i'm sorry
i meant to be emotional
erasing some of the luster off of you
but enough is enough
what is it that i enjoy the least?
little things, like a good haircut
or a good day, like a good performance
from a musical standpoint
i find it again
sometimes the things that excite me
are the things that excite me
the melodies are what excites me
the harmonies are what excites me
the harmonies are what excites me
all the same flowers that you blooming
are gone, gone, gone
in the air-conditioner
freak out of all people
this is really dangerous
i'm taking medicine
insulin is too expensive
i'm starving for what it wants
and i'm not starving for what i can give
it's become a habit
a way to start the day
it's become a mutual habit
a mutual habit
a mutual habit

if you're feeling generous
you can't take what's in your mouth
and lose
feel free to be generous
i won't blame you
for that
if you felt some superiority
and didn't deserve
it would just be another hard time
hard time
i feel wrong
lost, alone
but there's more to life than this
it's never been this kind of hard time
i don't know me for sure
i don't know me for sure
it's not meant to be a strife
yeah, i know
you're right
but there's more to life than this
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
oh i
you
you
you
you're trying too hard
surrender
give yourself in
you're trying too hard
you're trying too hard, ah
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
sweetly
it's not meant to be a strife
to enjoy this competition
you have to manage
i won't complain
much, much, much
i won't complain
i won't complain
about as rude of a music
as it gets
slamming against each other
like car parts
hang on, breathe
it's not meant to be a strife

====================
sweet-voiced warrior
we once were two galaxies apart
but now, almost a century on
there's still much to do
and fallible information scattered
overcome anxiety over
what to do with the rest
of my life
i'm struggling
perhaps the most
lulled-out child
recently arrived
my mother and son-in-law
recently arrived
and they both left
my heart is heavy on hurt
i'm trying to free her from me
but she insists on a smooth sailing
utopia
it seems impossible at the moment
but when you feel the urge to lunge
this way flows smoothly by me
free from fear
unfathomable speed
when you feel the urge to lunge
this way flows smoothly by me
what is it that i have
that makes me feel your pain?
it is, to some people, like, love
and more important
it is, to some people, like, love
and more important
it is, to some people, like, love
and more important
it is, to some people, like, love
and more important
it is, to some people, like, love
and more important
there is no ending
to suffering
i go through it
till it's over, and then
it's over, and you are all alone
i walk into the harbor
and see the sun come up
that is, all the way
to the top of the tallest mountain in Nantucket
and ask yourself:
what is it that i have
that makes me feel the need
to sacrifice?
what is it that i have
that makes me feel lesser?
ask yourself this question:
what is it that i have
that makes me feel lesser?

where is the line with you?

my purse wide open

i see the crime and
cash into accounts everywhere
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?

i want to be flexible
i want to go out
of my way for you
but enough is enough
where is the line with you?

i am elastic
i want to go out

i want to help you
where is the line with you?

i want to have

and be elastic, laa
to be elastic, elastic for you

i'm elastic for you
but enough

i can not live
peacefully without you
for even a moment
i miss you terribly
when you're away
he's away
this ain't right
i'm alone
i'm taking an aeroplane
across the world
to follow my heart
how come out of all the people in the world
only one can make me complete?
one word, one word on the phone
makes me happy
one touch, but one touch directly
makes me ecstatic
he's away
this ain't right
i'm alone
i'm taking an aeroplane
across the world
to follow my heart

why can't you give her room?
respect her spatial needs

go away
from me
without warning
and with me
as if on some mystical altar
i gather dust
and clock all the movements
i throw them on the ground
and remember to thank me
all that no one sees
i do that what i do
does what i say
does what i do
make me feel at home
i go away
from me
without warning
and with me
as if on some mystical altar
i gather dust
and time runs
it doesn't scare me anymore
i go away
from me

all that no one sees

and two suns ready
to shine just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it will all make sense
one day
you will blossom
one day, one day
when you're ready
an aeroplane
will curve gracefully
around the volcano
with the eruption that never lets you down
i can feel it
i can feel it
and the beautifullest
fireworks are burning
in the sky, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh
just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day

genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
so warm
sounds go through the muscles
these abstract, wordless movements
move, move, move, move, move
they start off cells that haven't been touched before
these cells are virgins
waking up slowly waking up
waking up slowly wake up
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
nothing will be the same
i'm asleep
i'm fast asleep
i like this resonance
it elevates me
i don't recognise myself
this is very interesting
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
i'm fast asleep now
you're still with me
i'm fast asleep
i'm asleep
my headphones
they saved, saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

====================
i love that you seem to care more about children than yours
you seem to enjoy funerals much more
how can you o-?
what's the biggest pain you've ever had to share?
your face is red and swollen and oh so tired
how can you offer me love like that?
you seem to be saying all the right things
saying "yes" to all the wants and needs of the world
and if you're having dreams
sounds go around the room
clock tower up there
your voice is rambling all around me
all i want is love
if you leave me here
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe

through the warmthest cord of care
your love was sent to me
i'm not sure what to do with it
or where to put it
i'm so close to tears
and so close to
simply calling you up
and simply suggesting
we go to that hidden place
that we go to that hidden place
we go to that hidden place
we go to the hidden place
now i have been slightly shy
and i can smell a pinch of hope
to almost have allowed one's fingers
to stroke the fingers i was given to touch with
but careful, careful
there lies my passion, hidden
there lies my love
i'll hide it under a blanket
lull it to sleep
i'll keep it in a hidden place
i'll keep it in a hidden place
keep it in a hidden place
keep it in a hidden place
safe in a hidden place
we'll stay in a hidden place
safe in a hidden place
we'll stay in a hidden place
we'll stay in a hidden place
we'll stay in a hidden place
we can forget all about you
we can forget all about you
we can forget all about you
it's okay...
we can forget all about you
we can forget all about you
it's ok...
we can forget all about you
we can forget all about you
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
it's not up to you

oh i
oh i
if living is seeing
i'm holding my breath
in wonder - i wonder
what happens next?
a new world, a new day to see

he means tomorrow but says, "in a bit"
and doesn't show up at all
he sets his watch to a comet's orbit
and remembers to forget to call
no courage for love, too scared to be happy
no courage for love, too scared to be happy
i do, do
i do, do
"your place or mine?" means "heaven or hell?"
two addresses somewhat apart
his home's dark and spiky, her's clear as a bell
it's over before they can start
no courage for love, too scared to be happy
no courage for love, too scared to be happy
i do, don't
i do, don't
and tomorrow passed them by

with our fingers, we make million holes
we cross valleys and mountains
in our multiplying attempts
to get what we have
we hit our peak there!
with our fingers, we make million holes
we build airfields for the Pope
war games with our fathers
and learn from their failures
we are the resistance
we are the ones who suffer
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
oh i
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
for if we were fighting uphill
we might well end it
undo the change and be with what you are
what is it you gave up?
for if you're losing, then maybe it's time to give up
you've seen what you lost
you're the one who gave up
you're the one who is willing to give up
and if you're losing, then maybe it's time to give up
you've seen what you lost

once you fell
your courage was so needed
by nature, her might
nature had it all
she was fierce
she made me come
it was of no use to her
and so harmful to human behaviour
nature had it all
she was ready to take on anyone
and so harmful to human behaviour
she made me come
nature was already against me
and so harmful to human behaviour
she made me come
nature was already against me

our romantic history
we broke up in 1953
we're both on our own
we were refugees
we were trying to run an empire

once you fell
you were already a threat
and yet so much
necessary
protection
in vatnajökul
from my cold fingers
i bent over the snow
and suck my tongue
down to the base
it is viscous
and it grows limp
in volume
i dare to swallow
and yet so much
necessary
protection
in vatnajök
from my cold fingers
i have reached the third step
and there is no one to stop me
let's step into that crowd!
there is no one to stop us
there is no one to stop us
there is no one to stop us
and when i get close
i will feel someone
something important
has happened
and that is why i am here
why we are singing
what is it that you say
that makes you say it?
it is that time-wander
that you say it
that you say it
that you may rest
we sing it
restoring the harmony
between mother and child
it is that time-wander
that you say it
that you say it
that you say it
that you may rest
we repeat it
restoring the harmony
between mother and child
it is that time-wander

hush - what is to do?
the riddle gets solved
and you push her up to
the highest peak
you commandeered the water
to raise a monument
to her the mysteries of childhood
born to be healed
in the warmth of a home
suffering through the cold
when my life is through
and the world behind
i'm standing up
i'm strong
alone
i'm strong
alone
i'm strong
alone
i'm strong
alone
alone
alone
apt for you the resistance, the solitude
just to get out of this is an offer to better themselves
perhaps we can go to a romantic rooftop
of your choosing?
the last time i went to a romantic rooftop
it was rain, man
and the girl
so how come out of all the rain

to climax?
to get to be able to offer yourself
to be generous

way back in the day
when i first started making guitars
i always said i wanted to live forever
now i've got a very loose band
it's just me
t-b style
but every time i play
it rips off my clothes
unpolished
i'm not even dressed
i'm just out of my mind
all this noise
it corrupts my sleep
so what's the use, noise caving
i wake up
and the day feels broken
i tilt my head
i'm trying to get an angle
'cause the evening
i've always longed for
it could still happen
how do i master
the perfect day
six glasses of water
seven phone calls
if you leave it alone
it might just happen
anyway
it's not meant to be as chaos
a musical
but enough is enough
it's not meant to be a strife
a political
show me that you can't manage
and i'll show you how
my heart is too heavy
i'm too broke
i'm not getting the memo
i'm calling you up
and it's true
i'm the one who said it
i'm the one who said it
you're trying too hard
crooked five
you're trying too hard
you're trying too hard
you're trying too hard, baby
it's not meant to be a strife
a political
show me that you can't manage
and i'll show you how
i can manage
and if you complain once more
you'll get the message
all the hate in the world
you can't handle
i'm less than
sure
i'm
sure
sure
say hi to
that's what i say
but you can't handle
i'm less than

if you ever get close to a human
and human behaviour
be ready, be ready to get confused
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
to human behaviour
but yet so, yet so irresistible
and there is no map
they're terribly, terribly, terribly moody
oh, human behaviour
then all of a sudden turn happy
but, oh, to get involved in the exchange
of human emotions
is ever so, ever so satisfying
and there is no map
human behaviour, human, human
human behaviour, human, human
human behaviour
human behaviour, human, human
and there is no map
and a compass wouldn't help at all

i get the green light to walk?
i get the green light to walk
i get the green light to walk?
i get the green light to walk?

i travel all around the city
go in and out of locomotives
all alone
there's no-one here
and people everywhere
crying 'cause i need you
crying i can feel you
crying 'cause i need you
crying 'cause i care
it's a hot day and i'm dressed lightly
i move carefully through the crowd
here everyone is so vulnerable
and i'm as well
there's no-one here
and people everywhere
crying 'cause i need you
crying i can feel you
crying 'cause i need you
crying 'cause i care
only if a ship would sail in
or just somebody came
====================
you were always there for me
you were always there for me
you were always there for me
you were always there for me
when you fall...

i remember
the beat of a beat
your fingers
i push them down on your fingers
the hairs on my fingers
i push them down on your fingers
and through the skin
i see the muscles
stroke, stroke, stroke
i see the veins run their runs through
let them assure you of the light
let them assure you of the warmth
let them assure you of the warmth
i see the veins run their runs through
let them assure you of the light
let them assure you of the warmth
the last drop of blood
i see the same vessels that were used as prying eyes
to spot a danger in a stranger
to spot a danger in a stranger
a flame that is flame, an army that is army
i see the same vessels that were used as a prying eye
to spot a danger in a stranger
to spot a danger in a stranger
a flame that is flame, an army that is army
swallows up all its body
and darts into the air
like a wave
engines health
like a torrent
comes towards you
and down on your knees
i rest my head
there is no-one here
and yet here i go
when you fall
i will be dancing with you
thrilling your batteries
charging your radio
charging your watch
thrilling your batteries
while i go to bed
night falls slow
i make my presence known
to all who know me

you are gonna be fine
just fine without you
you're gonna be fine
you're gonna be fine
you're gonna be fine
you're gonna be fine
smooth soft red velvety lungs
are pushing a network of oxygen joyfully
through a nose, through a mouth
but all enjoys enjoyably
while i grow fine
the hairs on my arms stand ready
to defend me
when i grow medium-man
i shall defend you
when i grow big
i shall defend you
i shall defend you
you are gonna be fine
just fine without me
you're gonna be fine
you're gonna be fine
you're gonna be fine
smooth soft red velvety lungs
are pushing a network of oxygen joyfully
through a mouth, through a nose
but all enjoysably
while i grow fine
the hairs on my arms stand ready
to defend me
when i grow big
i should be allowed
to express my feelings
safely
but not too aggressively
there's nothing wrong
licence, licence, licence
i express my feelings
safely
but not too aggressively
there's nothing wrong
there's more to life than this
i'm sensitive
i like that
i love you
but more
than this
i'm not giving her all
there's more to life than this
i'm sensitive
i like that
she's delicate
she's bearing
this risk
for her family
but this is life
and she'll take it
all in his mouth
when she feels like it
i nod my head
she'll take it all in
his mouth isodon
the littleness of his movements
while she sleeps
he watches over her, watches over himself
until they fall
the world we all know
will be made of this earth
ahem) pardon my spelling
but i didn't say favor
to intrude

it's wet in the middle
with a shell around our neck
it's still in your hands
you readied yourself
you're up in the air
reading a triumph
you're the strongest
you came out of my mouth
this is the first time in my life
youre happy
you know that i love you
you know that i love you
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm
jump off
your building's on fire
and i'll catch you
it's coming down the pipe
it's gonna be hard
if i only could
shelter you

i know what i'd do
i'd go down in the harbor
and jump off
with youroes and oars

down in the cellar in the boho zone
i went looking for some sweet inspiration, oh well
just another hard time band with negro affectations
i was a hopeful in rooms like this
when i was working cheap
it's an old romance, the boho dance
hasn't gone to sleep
but even on the scuffle
the cleaner's press was in my jeans
and any eye for detail
caught a little lace along the seams
and you were in the parking lot
subterranean by your own design
the virtue of your style inscribed
on your contempt for mine
jesus was a beggar, he was rich in grace
and solomon kept his head in all his glory
it's just that some steps outside the boho dance
have a fascination for me
a camera pans the cocktail hour
behind a blind of potted palms
and finds a lady in a paris dress
with runs in her nylons
you read those books where luxury
comes as a guest to take a slave
books where artists in noble poverty
go like virgins to the grave
don't you get sensitive on me
'cause i know you're just too proud
you couldn't step outside the boho dance now
even if good fortune allowed
like a priest with a pornographic watch
looking and longing on the sly
sure it's stricken from your uniform
but you can't get it out of your eyes
nothing is capsulized in me
on either side of town
the streets were never really mine
not mine, not mine, these glamor gowns

all of my mouth was kissing him
now, into the air, i am missing him
is this excess texting a blessing?
two music nerds obsessing
he reminds me of the love in me
i'm celebrating on a vibrancy
sending each other mp3s
falling in love to a song
this handsomest of wickermen
he asked if i could wait for him
now, how many lightyears this interim
while i fall in love with his songs?
his hands are good in protecting me
touching and caressing me
but would it be trespassing
wanting him to be blissing me
robbing him of his youth?
cliffhanger like suspension
my longing has formed its own skeleton
bridging the gap between singletons
sending each others these songs
the interior of these melodies
is perhaps where we are meant to be
our physical union a fantasy
i just fell in love with a
====================
your hands are good in protecting me
but would it be excessive or inappropriate?

i should care

he turned me down, i then downturned another
who then downturned her
the paralyzing juice of rejection
his veins full of lead
he's left with loving what he lost
more than what he has
my snakeskin cold in the dark
but warms up in the light
i then upturned a green eyed giant
who upturned and entered me
will we stop seeing what unites us
but only what differs?
the ghosts of old loves
hovering around his orifices, his orifices...
as you narrate your own hearttale
you thread souls into one beam
the love you gave and have been given
weave into your own dream
i trust my cells to rearchive
my love historic stream

threading
the glacier head
looking hard for
moments of shine
from twilight
to twilight

i've seen it all, i have seen the trees
i've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
i've seen a man killed by his best friend
and lives that were over before they were spent
i've seen what i was — i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru!
i'm happy to say i had better to do
what about china? have you seen the great wall?
all walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!
and the man you will marry?
the home you will share?
to be honest, i really don't care...
you've never been to niagara falls?
i have seen water, it's water, that's all...
the eiffel tower, the empire state?
my pulse was as high on my very first date!
your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?
to be honest, i really don't care...
i've seen it all, i've seen the dark
i've seen the brightness in one little spark
i've seen the darkest pockets of darkness
i've seen the strongest, the bravest
and that is why i am here
i'm a ranger
i'm a light saber-wieldinger
taming differences
trance-like
butler not bad, bud
he's foot soldier
braver than you seem
i should be proud
i'm a little nervy
i'm a little nervy
i'm a little nervy about

i'm not into

mine is long and lean
lil' man is too lazy
i can assure you
that you will meet him
in the city
or the cafe
where i met you
and asked if i could wait
i couldn't wait to meet you yet?
yet? i hoped to meet you
but the chance meeting you promised me
would make me lonely?
not anymore
i'm a newbie
i know all the amenities of town
but would never go to the place
that made me feel it
i'd never go to the place
that made me feel it
i'd never go to the place
that made me feel it
i'd never go to the place
you were never far away
you were always so far away
i'm sure i should stay

a lullaby sings to a lost boy
peace out of a war
he reminds me of how we used to go to the beach
wanderlust! war!
every time you go down to the harbor
you go in the boat and look for the motherfucker
there you are, sat cross-legged
crawling before the sea
embraces me whole
and says, "this way is all"
the way is up here
this way is all here
here i come
down to this remote lake
this place is made of hearts
this is why i love this place
this is why i love this place
this is why i love this place

while i crawl ashore
saying my best
no one wants to hear what i've to say
and they point where i go
then the ocean comes out
and it scales my head
i can't say no to hope
i can't say no to happiness
no one wants to hear what i've to say
and they point where i go
then the ocean comes out
and it scales my head
i can't say no to hope

i wake up
slow down
your runs of the mouth
you're so strong
you deserve to be hugged
and held
down the toilet
with the blunt object
in hand
i wake up
slow down
slow down
slow down
slow down
i know you've got stubborn things to say
i know you've got strengths
i know you've got weaknesses
i know, i know
you're trying too hard
to impress
miserly
with your witty
no one wants to hear it
and they point where it goes
i can't say no to hope
i can't say no to happiness
no one wants to hear it
and they point where it goes
i can't say no to hope
i can't say no to happiness
no one wants to hear it
softer, gentler
than you expected
and you sounded happier
than you did
to think that i might come after
you went through the wringer
and charged into the unknown
how you reacted
like a virus, bulking up
looking like somebody who lost their lives
but you haven't been charged with murder
murderous?
murderous?
murderous?
i'm pretty sure i'd answered the door
and burst into the unknown
shot the object up above
like someone who lost their lives
but you haven't been charged with murder

what's the lesser of two evils
if she kills them or dies in vain?
nature has fixed no limits on our hopes
oh, what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils

eternal whirlwind
i have fostered since childhood
well, i don't care
love is all
i dare to drown
to be proven wrong

when your eyes pause on the ball
that hangs on the third branch from the star
you remember why it is dark
and why it gets light again
the earth, like the heart, slopes in its seat
and, like that, it travels along an elliptical path
drawn into the darkness
an unpolished pearl
in sky-black palm of hand
flickering sun-flame
and then you remember
that you, yourself, you are a light-bearer, a light-bearer
receiving radiance from others
flickering sun-flame
unpolished earth in palm of hand

show me forgiveness
for having lost faith in myself
and let my own interior up
to inferior forces
the shame is endless
but if soon start forgiveness
the girl might live

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
i see who you are
i see who you.... are...

it may not always be so
and i say that if your lips
which i have loved
should touch another's
and your dear strong fingers clutch her heart
as mine in time not far away
if on another's face your sweet hair lay
in such a silence as i know
or such great writhing words as, uttering overmuch
stand helplessly before the spirit at bay
if this should be, i say if this should be
you of my heart, send me a little word
that i may go unto her, and take her hands saying
accept all happiness from me
then i shall turn my face
and hear one bird sing terribly afar in the lost lands

when will it be time to document?
do it now!
this submarine behaviour
do it now!
when time?
do it now!
to return
do it now!
do it now!
shake us out of the heavy deep sleep
shake us now!
do it now!

shake us out of the heavy deep sleep
do it now!

when i spot someone who is same height as you
and goes to same record stores
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
when i hear someone with same accent as yours
asking directions with the same beard as yours
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
isn't it odd?
isn't it peculiar?
these statistics of my mind
shuffling your features
assembling a man
googling love
warming my heart on this log fire of love
features creatures
features creatures
features creatures
features creatures
his orifices
his orifices

i can sense it
something important
is about to happen
it's coming up
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
we just met
and i know i'm a bit too intimate
but something huge is coming up
and we're both included
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
i don't know my future after this weekend
and i don't want to
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality, sensuality

he turned me down, i then downturned another
who then downturned her
the paralyzing juice of rejection
his veins full of lead
he's left with loving what he lost
more than what he has
my snakeskin cold in the dark
but warms up in the light
i then upturned a green eyed giant
who upturned and entered me
will we stop seeing what unites us
but only what differs?
the ghosts of old loves
hovering around his orifices, his orifices...
as you narrate your own hearttale
you thread souls into one beam
the love you gave and have been given
weave into your own dream
i trust my cells to rearchive
my love historic stream

threading
the glacier head
looking hard for
moments of shine
from twilight
to twilight

with a cross necklace

i'm going hunting
i'm sharpening
i'm getting better
at this i regret the whole thing
a few surprises
in store for me tomorrow
a romantic invitation
if you remember
it will be in my mailbox
in a little drawer
in the living room of my living room
a little corner of the house
in the world of Pablo
i want to be in his arms
and not let him get me down
i want to be with him forever
i want to be with him forever
and if he insists on getting hurt
i'll strip, blindfold him, and force him to open up
then he will enjoy all the satisfaction
since we broke up
i'm using lipstick again
i suck my tongue
in remembranceofyou
whoever you are
will alwaysbe and ever will be
and will ever be
i want to be with you

same from the start
it doesn't scare me at all
i want to go out
of my way for you
i'm sure your hearts are telling the truth
exploring the city
learning by love to get to know you
you're the one who comes up
one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it doesn't scare me at all
you're the one who comes up
one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it doesn't scare me at all
you're the one who comes up

one day
the forest gets thinner by the day
the waves become thinner by the day
more air comes pouring in
from all directions
like rain from the sky
carnage is all around!

one day
it doesn't scare me at all
you're the innocent guy
who stars are unfazed
by the world around you
you're the boy who doesn't get pinned up
with explosives
drawn into place
by the speed of light
you dodge bullets from aight
drawn into place
foot soldier
march ahead
you'll be bearing witness
to the triumph of aacity
against all odds
you'll be led by my hand
to the death
of the family
it would be a massacre
not of my family
but of all of us
who were led astray
hurt, hurt
by circumstances
that remained the same
and none of us would understand
why
 i felt the need
to fill you in
harden the mystery
you'd never know
about me
you'd never know about me
you doubted my worth
hurt in any way
hurt in any way
hurt in any way
the thrill of fear
rescue me
from level-head
and the unnecessary luxury of being calm

he reminds me of the love
farce of my childhood
suffering without hope
justice without hope
family without love
he reminds me of his childhood
the rambling on the ground
repeating a pattern
every cell in his body
tear apart
destroy all legal hindrance
family without love
justice without love
family without love
family without love
and then i'll tear him up
and then i'll tear him up
family without love
family without love
i'll tear him up, family without love

just keep on coming
i'll come right out
and say the things i do
and they'll be right back
just keep on coming
family without love

my heart comes undone
slowly unravels

be ready, be ready to get confused
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
to human behaviour
but yet so, yet so irresistible
and there is no map
they're terribly, terribly, terribly moody
oh, human behaviour
then all of a sudden turn happy
but, oh, to get involved in the exchange
of human emotions
is ever so, ever so satisfying

i'm sure you've seen me out of this
maybe you've seen me just lean into a cellar door
and feel a sudden rush of satisfaction - to suddenly be in a room like this
of infinite complexity and complexity
with people like you, all over me
and i can't get no...
what is it that i can't get rid of?
i've seen it all - there is no more to see!
all of us here share a bond that is unequaled
every nerve that hurts - there is no more to do!
and i will not get no for i'm the one who does it
you can't say no to hope
you can't say no to happiness
it will not come true
i'm sorry you saw that
i'm sorry he did it
an imposter is a man
in mourning
for the death of his child
a drug dealer who poisoned his daughter
a suicide bomber who went on a suicide mission
where is the line that i cross?
where is the line that i'm willing to cross?
where is the line that i'm willing to cross?
where is the line that i'm willing to cross?
and that is what i've always meant by 'crossingays'?
i've seen what i was and i know what i'll be
i've seen it all - there is no more to see!
and if you ask yourself now, 'how am i going to make it right?' then you will know quickly that i am the one to answer
and if you ask yourself now, 'how am i going to make it right?' then you will know quickly that i am the one to answer

if you ask yourself now, 'how am i going to make it right?,' then you will know that i am the one to answer

how can you offer me love like that?
how can you offer me love like that?
how can you offer me love like that?

while i crawl into the unknown
cover me
i'm going hunting for mysteries
cover me
i'm going to prove the impossible exists
this is really dangerous
cover me
but worth all the effort
cover me
i'm going to prove the impossible really exists

there is yet another one
that follows me
wherever i go
and supports me
all this tooth is warmth-like
this tooth is warmth-like
this tooth is warmth-like
and these teeth are a ladder up to his mouth
all these teeth are a ladder that i walk
that you can walk too if you want
if you want up to the mouth
the mouth's cradle
up to the mouth's cradle
he always has a hope for me
always sees me when nothing else
and everyone have left
that ghost is brighter than anyone
and fulfills me with hope
those beams assure me
and you can use these teeth as a ladder
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
and you can follow these notes i'm singing
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
the simplicity of the ghost-like beast
the purity of what it

get over the sorrow, girl
the world is always going to be made of this
you can trust in it
unless you breathe in
bravely
i adore how you simply surrender to high
and your lungs, they're mourning
t-b style
all the stillborn love that could've happened
all the moments you should have embraced
all the moments you should have not locked up
understand so clearly:
to shut yourself up
would be the hugest crime of them all
hugest crime of them all
you're just crying after all
to not want them humans around
anymore
get over that sorrow, girl
get over it

hollow
my ancestors have access
hollow
i'm falling down the abyss
hollow
looking for some answers
generations of mothers sailing in
somehow they all were shipfolks

i need a shelter to build an altar away
from all osamas and bushes
i'm rediscovering my roots
this time it's in the soil
it never really was
it's now or never will be
it's up to you
but you gotta find out for yourself
i've made mistakes
too great to ignore
but the ones i've made right
and the ones i've not made in vain
you can trust in this
now is the right time to take charge
of this incredible high
now is the right time to take charge
of this incredible high
you're all right
take care

you just did what you had to do
you just did what you had to do
you just did what you had to do

the time it takes a tear to fall
a snake to shed its skin
is all the time that's needed
to forgive, forgive me
you are forgiven
come on, hurry
i killed your man
you have to hurry up
i called the police
they're just down the road
they've come for me
why should i run?
they'll take your money
run for your boy
silly selma, you're all right
there's more to life than this
you know that i love you
you know that i love you
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm
jump off
your building's on fire
and i'll catch you
i'll catch you
destroy all that is keeping you down
and then i'll nurse you
i'll nurse you
i'll protect you
you know that i love you
you know that i love you
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm

i wake up

it might just happen

if you leave it alone
it could sneak up on you
possibly big time
i could catch you
just lean into the crack
and it wouldn't bother you

get over the sorrow, girl
the world is always going to be made of this
you can trust in it
unless you breathe in
bravely
i adore how you simply surrender to high
and your lungs, they're mourning
t-b style
all the stillborn love that could've happened
all the moments you should have embraced
all the moments you should have not locked up
understand so clearly:
to shut yourself up
would be the hugest crime of them all
hugest crime of them all
you're just crying after all
to not want them humans around
anymore
get over that sorrow, girl
get over it

our love was our bond
we had to mend
we'd break it
if she hurt me at all
you couldn't blame her for that
it would be a heart attack

i have seen angels
i know they're there

and if she hurt me so
much more
i'm sure she will
and if she hurts me
you can't blame her for that
it would be a heart attack

just leave me

ég var á vappi niðri við höfn - á bryggjunni stóð hann
hann sagði mér frá landi einu, langt af leið það er
on nú er eins og eitthvað hafi brostið inní mér
alta mira - ævintýralanið er
alta mira - þangað hugurinn mig ber
alta mira - ævintýralanið er

sá gamli sagði mer þar sólin sægræn væri á lit
i sjónum spekingslegar syntu kýrnar út á hlið
hann seli sá í söngleik í silfurtitum skóm
um torgin töltu tífælur í kjólfötum með blóm

all this love comes true
all around you
all loves are matched
all loves are matched
all loves are matched
you are going to raise a monument of love
this way is as it should be
you are going to raise a monument of love
this way is as it should be

i remember you
you're the one that said, "i love you too
didn't you know?"
i remember you
you're the one that said, "i love you too
didn't you know?"
i remember you

while i crawl into the unknown
cover me
i'm going hunting for mysteries
cover me
i'm going to prove the impossible exists
this is really dangerous
cover me
but worth all the effort
cover me
i'm going to prove the impossible really exists

there is yet another one
that follows me
wherever i go
and supports me
all this tooth is warmth-like
this tooth is warmth-like
this tooth is warmth-like
and these teeth are a ladder up to his mouth
all these teeth are a ladder that i walk
that you can walk too if you want
if you want up to the mouth
the mouth's cradle
up to the mouth's cradle
he always has a hope for me
always sees me when nothing else
and everyone have left
that ghost is brighter than anyone
and fulfills me with hope
those beams assure me
and you can use these teeth as a ladder
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
and you can follow these notes i'm singing
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
the simplicity of the ghost-like beast
the purity of what it wants and where it goes
always love, always loves you, always loves you
infrared love
and you can use those teeth as a ladder
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
and you can use those teeth, oh, follow my voice
tooth by tooth
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
i need a shelter to build an altar away
from all osamas and bushes
i need a shelter to build an altar away
from all osamas and bushes

i once had no fears
none at all
and then when
i had some
to my surprise
i grew to like both
scared or brave
without them
the thrill of fear
thought i'd never admit it
the thrill of fear
now greatly enjoyed with courage
when i once was
untouchable
innocence roared
still amazes
when i once was
innocent
it is still here
but in different places
neurosis
only
attaches
itself to
fertile
ground
where it can flourish
the thrill of fear
thought i'd never admit it
the thrill of fear
now greatly enjoyed with courage
when i once was
fearless
innocence roared
still amazes
untouch

Frankenstein

in a forest pitch-dark
glowed the tiniest spark
it burst into a flame
like me, like me
and the souls in me
who were in me wake

our love was my soul
but the brightness disappeared
as my body politic
declared war on Christianity
let's open up: let's denounce all bigotry
declare war on all sexism
declare war on all homophobia
declare war on all childhood sexual abuse
how will i fight exploitation?

declare war on all bigotry
declare war on all religions
declare war on all minds

that way
i'm overcome
with grief

for my emotional stunts
only on this earth can i move

i'm capable of

let's unite
we don't fight each other
let's form a path
all curves towards me
and down to the navel

maybe he will come out of this
maybe he won't
somehow i'm not too bothered either way
maybe he will come out of this loving me
maybe he will come out of this
i'm dry and stinking simple
i'm a bilberry hiding in vat
i'm blind and witless
and the world is listening
i'm a little confused
maybe he will come out of this
or he will come out of this
maybe he won't
i'm not taming no animal
maybe he will come out of this
once it was simple
one feeling at a time
it reached its peak then transformed
these abstract complex feelings
i just don't know how to handle them
should i throw oil on one of these moods
but which one?
the joy peak
humor peak
frustration peak
anything peak
for clarity
maybe he will come out of this
maybe he won't
i'm not taming no animal
maybe he will come out of this
maybe he will come out of this
maybe he won't
somehow i'm not too bothered either way
somehow i'm not too bothered either way
i refuse, it's a sign of maturity
to be stuck in complexity
i demand all clarity
maybe he will come out of this
or he will come out of this
or he will come out of this
or he will come out of this
all of us
are asking ourselves
how can i step away from this complexity
and not be separated by walls?
by means of lights, sounds, communication
malfeasors, they are headquartered
our home is in the city
but there's another side to town
that sees me as a whole
and holds me in its arms
it is the world's ear
to close your eyes
and look at the sky
or the mountains or the ocean
all of us
are reflecting
on the day we left
and the morning we went back
there's still life to be seen
and all of us here
passionate fans
we've got to close our eyes
and look at the sky
or the mountains or the ocean
all of us
have just gone through the hard time
there's still life to be seen
and all of us here
has just gone through the hard time
passionate fans
we've got to close our eyes
and look at the sky
or the mountains or the ocean
has just gone through the hard time
passionate fans

one breath away from death
we'll be carried away
with joy
i dare you
to take me on
maybe he will come out of this
or he will turn out to be a killer
we know that he won't
we know that he won't want us
anymore
joyful death
is going to be hard
it takes courage to be happy
and the hardcore critic
i've shown me
there's no beauty that i've never seen
i've seen people who were as pure as i was
and i didn't even notice
for me to even notice
for me to even notice
i've always been a lover
a little jealousy won't do
i've seen what i've got
and if i mess it up
i'll make fun of it all
i'll make fun of it all
i've seen what i've got
you can't say no to hope
can't say no to happiness
it's not meant to be a struggle
it's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle
i'll bring happiness to all
i'll bring happiness to all
i've seen what i've got
you can't say no to hope
can't say no to happiness
it's not meant to be a struggle
it's not meant to be a struggle
it's not meant to be a struggle
it's not meant to be a struggle
it's not meant to be a struggle
it's not meant to be a struggle

it is so important
that you not only recover from this loss, but help repair the damage
it is important that you not only recover from this loss, but help help
this girl means business
and not a single penny of your hard-earned money
she left your hard-earned money in a syrupy bowl
that she left undone
it's important that you not only recover from this loss, but help help

don't get angry with yourself
don't, don't get angry with yourself
i'll heal you
with a razor blade i'll cut a slit open
and the luminous beam will come to me
ever so gently
i'll heal you
finally
i'll heal you
all that you said was true
all that you said was true
all that you said was true
so unhinged
and so ungloved
i can feel it
i can feel it
on the skin
unpolished
glowed in the dark
glowed in the light
and the luminous beam
glowed in the same spot
as if there were romantic notes
shuffling of locks
sunlight reflects off of earth
luminous
i can feel it
i can feel it
all that i gave them was true
all that i gave them was true
all that i gave them was true

allure, pearl
is all is found
in the distance
you say your prayers
to be safe from the day
i come to you
i wake you up
in the nick of time
to be safe from the night
i come to you
i wake you up
in the nick of time
to be safe from the day

all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love

once you fell out of love
our love couldn't carry you
and i didn't even notice
for our love kept me safe from death
you doubted the light
and the shelter it can give
for in love we are immortal
eternal and safe from death
if i regret us
i'm denying my soul to grow
don't remove my pain
it is my chance to heal
we carry the same wound
but have different cures
similar injuries
but opposite remedies
after our love ended
your arms don't carry me
without love i feel the abyss
understand your fear of death
i will not forget
this notget
will you not regret
having love let go?
after our love ended
your spirit entered me
now we are the guardians
we'll keep her safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
safe, safe from...
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death

if you ever get close to a human
there's a saying that i've followed closely
once it was cold outside and the man you met was still here
you wouldn't know it either way
i wasn't trained to be aggressive or rude
but when i saw you smiling broadly
you turned me on, on, on, on
no one should ever guess what's coming next
a thunderbolt through the air
will send shivers down my spine
i'll stay still and take the first step
probably will, probably will
probably will, probably will
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death

i have a recurrent dream
every time i lose my voice
i swallow little glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me
during the nights
they do a trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above my bed
while i'm asleep
my mother and son pour into me
warm glowing oil
into my wide open throat
i have a recurrent dream
every time i feel a hoarseness
i swallow warm glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me, oh
they make me feel so much better
they make me feel better
we have a recurrent dream
every time we lose our voices

we could halo all the way
to the top
and see the sun come up
that is, all the way
i should go
to get some water
for the girl
that is, the tree
that grows tall
for in me
there is pain
i've made a mistake
and i'll heal it
i've slowly grown
initiated a healing dance
that is, it is coming to a close
the branches are refreshing
the sun is gone
i'm in good hands
with a new coat
i'm giving it to the lady
oh, the branches are rejoicing
with a new coat

how can i forget?
the sins in me
they're still there
but they're turning me down
silly selma, you've betrayed your oath
turning me down
silly selma, you've betrayed your oath
i'm going to prove it
with a new coat
of perspiration
in a little experiment
i'm going to prove it
with a new coat of perspiration

i'm going to prove it
with a new copycat
in a little experiment
and when i'm through
the money's up
there, there it is
there, there it is
i'm going to do my best to make it right
but much needs doing
the heavy hearted omake of you
you're going to home
raise a nest of good tunes
your playfully minded attorneys
i'm not taming no animal
but you're making them happy
you know that i like your style
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm
jump off
your building's on fire
and i'll catch you
i'm not taming no animal
but you're making them happy
you know that i like your style
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm

i wake up
and the day feels a-broken
i tilt my head
i wish i was on a mountain top
and felt the speed of sound
all connected
each other and were
lately
i find myself out gazing at
things that were happening in
this state of emergency
i wake up
and the day feels a-broken
i tilt my head
i wish i was on a mountain top
and looked at this huge sky
grey in the dark
how will i go about it?

====================
jesus christ
he is a beast of burden
he is a beautiful boat
loaded with presents
he left behind
beautifully choreographed
he has soft elastic around his ankles
he is undressed
unclothed
soft on my knees
knot stretching
agile lashing out
we are the sharp end
we are the sharp end
we are the sharp end
if you get close
then we'll sting a bit
you know that i love you
you know that i love you
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm
come quickly
you are the intruder
you are the intruder
you are the intruder
let's break this chain
right away
but before i do
i should light a cigarette
anger is the key
to happiness is to agree
to agree to something
i must first agree
to something
to be able to agree
to something
to be able to agree
to something like that
to agree to something
this would be a very bad idea
i'm certain that if i were you
i would close my heart
forbidden places
like these gypsies
they're not welcome here
anymore
and if i were you i would close my heart
forbidden places
like these traps
are not here
this is to protect you
but to show that i love you
you are in me
this is a dangerous place
but here i go
with a steadfast heart
murmuring slides
like these teeth
in sockets called eyes
i see what i get up to
and teeth that say:
ally of ya
vegan, polytheist, vegan
yes, and that ya'll follow
with a steadfast eye
whirl around the same tooth
and say:
say hey, hey, hey
vegan, polytheist, vegan
yes, and that ya'll follow
with a steadfast eye
whirl around the same tooth
and say:
say hey, hey, hey
vegan, polytheist, vegan
yes, and that ya'll follow
with a steadfast eye
whirl around the same tooth
and say:
say hey, hey, hey
vegan, polytheist, vegan
yes, and that ya'll follow
with a steadfast eye
whirl around the same tooth
say:
say hey, hey, hey
vegan, polytheist, vegan
yes, and that ya'll follow
with a steadfast eye

when you're ready
say hey, hey, hey
vegan, polytheist, vegan
yes, and i know
i've 'em wide awake
all biding their time
hearing voices
exploring
exploring
exploring
when you get ready
say hey, hey, hey
vegan, polytheist, vegan
yes, and i know
i've got energized
i've got veins full of water
i'm literally blooming
in a southern brooklyn
right here in the city
the lights are up, the stars are in the sky
hullum level-go
go get ready for the biggest boom in years
we're heading west
vegan, polytheist, vegan
yes, and i know
i've got plenty to grow me
 i've got plenty to offer
and if you think i'll let you pull me down to your parking lot
i'll pull over there
and take you hostage
i know you'll pay for it
i know you got to get over it
so get ready, vegans
get ready, get ready
you've got to get over it
i know you'll love it
if you think i'll let you pull me down to your parking lot
i'll pull over there
and take you hostage
i know you'll love it
i've got to get over it
i've got to get over
oh, you see, i know you
you've got to get over it
or i'll break it
an important rule
and break the law
baby, you see i'm breakin
an important rule
and break the law
you see, i know you
you're breakin' me around
saying hi
to all
you see me out of the blue
you see i'm all right
and the things that happen
ircumstance-wise
i sorta get uptight
ask all of you
to respect i's set
and detail
you ask for my approval
you give me permission to make changes
i might modify the write-up, for example
maybe a pecan roof
maybe a clementine sign
maybe a little something
carnage-wise
i sort of get upt
====================
hasn't killed all
and if she has to
how many children will she have?
how many day-care centers would she like to open?
how many private jet flights would she need?
all of this is taking place
right now
it's just over a week away from when i send you my love letter
and the day has just come and gone
but it hasn't happened yet?
yet?
your heart is heavy on the down drive
and it is saying the least

it is the downstroke
that defines us
the key to unlocking the moments

emotional landscapes
they puzzle me

maybe he will come out of this
maybe he won't
somehow i'm not too bothered either way
maybe he will come out of this loving me
maybe he will come out of this
i smell declarations of solitude
maybe he will come out of this
vietnam vet comes after the war
lands in my house
this wild lion doesn't fit in this chair

maybe he will come out of this
once it was simple
one feeling at a time
it reached its peak then transformed
these abstract complex feelings
i just don't know how to handle them
should i throw oil on one of these moods
but which one?
the joy peak
humor peak
frustration peak
anything peak
for clarity
maybe he will come out of this loving me

i'm not taming no animal

somehow i'm not too bothered either way
somehow i'm not too bothered either way
i refuse, it's a sign of maturity
to be stuck in complexity
i demand all clarity
maybe he will come out of this
or he will feel solitaire

i'd just like to know

all of my mouth was kissing him
now, into the air, i am missing him
is this excess texting a blessing?

====================
the swarm might swarm you, mirage might creep up on you
you are the intruder
the jewels in the crown
seems like a good time now to lull me to sleep
you are the intruder
the jewels in the crown
now, to be more clear
there is no more to say
no more to be had
i've opened my heart for you
swirling black lilies totally ripe
a juxtaposition of destiny
who would have known that a boy like you would grow up
a wound as wide as your hand
a secret that you would not share
a sight to see
i wish to be in a family of your own
of your own making
of our own making
of our own making
i wish to be in a precious musical
of your own making
of our own making
of our own making's sake
we're leaving this harbor
giving second thought to all
what's the lesser of two evils
if a suicide bomber made to look pregnant
manages to kill her target or not?
what's the lesser of two evils
if she kills them or dies in vain?
nature has fixed no limits on our hopes
oh, what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if her bump was fake or if it was real?
here's my version of it
eternal whirlwind
i have fostered since childhood
well, i don't care
love is all
i dare to drown
to be proven wrong

when your eyes pause on the ball
that hangs on the third branch from the star
you remember why it is dark
and why it gets light again
the earth, like the heart, slopes in its seat
and, like that, it travels along an elliptical path
drawn into the darkness
an unpolished pearl
in sky-black palm of hand
flickering sun-flame
and then you remember
that you, yourself, you are a light-bearer, a light-bearer
receiving radiance from others
flickering sun-flame
unpolished earth in palm of hand

show me forgiveness
for having lost faith in myself
and let my own interior up
to inferior forces
the shame is endless
but if soon start forgiveness
the girl might live

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
i see who you are
i see who you.... are...

it may not always be so
and i say that if your lips
which i have loved
should touch another's
and your dear strong fingers clutch her heart
as mine in time not far away
if on another's face your sweet hair lay
in such a silence as i know
or such great writhing words as, uttering overmuch
stand helplessly before the spirit at bay
if this should be, i say if this should be
you of my heart, send me a little word
that i may go unto her, and take her hands saying
accept all happiness from me
then i shall turn my face
and hear one bird sing terribly afar in the lost lands

when will it be time to document?
do it now!
this submarine behaviour
do it now!
when time?
do it now!
to return
do it now!
do it now!
shake us out of the heavy deep sleep
shake us now!
do it now!
do it now!
shake us out of the heavy deep sleep
do it now!

is the loneliest place in the world, and you know that i love you?
like you, i've gone through the loneliest of whirlwinds
i've fallen from high
and onto the ground
poor me
it's become a habit
a calling
a philosophy
it's unbreakable
it's possible
it's coming to
fence you in
it's all there
it's all there
it's all there
it's all there for you
you can't get no
it's all there for you
there's no limit to where i want to be
it's all there for you
there's no limit to where i want to be

admiring your lava
i throw myself into the sea

i handle things
with some courage
and resolve
and then i'll return the favor
may i, might i, should i, or have i too often
lull my daughter too heavily?

i kills typos
the other way around
i respects all typographic conventions
and comes up with fully formed words
i then re-builds those words over and over
sometimes i find myself transcribing
up to the mouth
the wolf yet to swallow
i'm not taming yet
but the likenesse is there
i'm taming
and the species it’s molestation of
is trying to correct
it's difficulty recognising
the purity of what it wants and
what it doesn't want
now i'm recognising it, recognising it
'cause when i thought i'd rid myself of, i couldn't manage:

when i spot someone who is same height as you
and goes to same record stores
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
when i hear someone with same accent as yours
asking directions with the same beard as yours
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
isn't it odd?
isn't it peculiar?
these statistics of my mind
shuffling your features
assembling a man
googling love
warming my heart on this log fire of love
features creatures
features creatures
features creatures
features creatures
his orifices
his orifices

i can sense it
something important
is about to happen
it's coming up
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
we just met
and i know i'm a bit too intimate
but something huge is coming up
and we're both included
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
i don't know my future after this weekend
and i don't want to
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality, sensuality

he turned me down, i then downturned another
who then downturned her
the paralyzing juice of rejection
his veins full of lead
he's left with loving what he lost
more than what he has
my snakeskin cold in the dark
but warms up in the light
i then upturned a green eyed giant
who upturned and entered me
will we stop seeing what unites us
but only what differs?
the ghosts of old loves
hovering around his orifices, his orifices...
as you narrate your own hearttale
you thread souls into one beam
the love you gave and have been given
weave into your own dream
i trust my cells to rearchive
my love historic stream

threading
the glacier head
looking hard for
moments of shine
from twilight
to twilight

i've seen it all, i have seen the trees
i've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
i've seen a man killed by his best friend
and lives that were over before they were spent
i've seen what i was — i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru!
i'm happy to say i had better to do
what is to do?
take a taxi
move in the opposite direction
of the coin
of the rival
who is closer
to winning
and the lesser players
who are furthest away
who can make it out of the group
t-score: five
to go!
====================
free will and independence are the keys
to happiness
why do i love this mess?
why do i want this mess?
why do i want this mess?

i'm a fountain of blood
in the shape of a girl
you're the bird on the brim
hypnotised by the whirl
drink me, make me feel real
wet your beak in the stream
game we're playing is life
love's a two way dream
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a path of cinders
burning under your feet
you're the one who walks me
i'm your one way street
i'm a whisper in the water
secret for you to hear
you're the one who grows distant
when i beckon you near
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a tree that grows hearts
one for each that you take
you're the intruder's hand
i'm the branch that you break

my healed chest wound
transformed into a gate
where i receive love from
where i give love from
and i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
split into many parts
splattered light beams into prisms
that will reunite
if you care for me, care for me
if you care for me, care for me
care for me, care for me
and then i'll care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
didn't used to be so needy
just more broken than normal
proud self-sufficiency
my silhouette is oval
it is a gate
i can care for you, care for you from
i can care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
you care for me, care for me
care for you

shh, shh
it's oh, so quiet, shh, shh
it's oh, so still, shh, shh
you're all alone, shh, shh
and so peaceful until
you fall in love, zing boom
the sky up above, zing boom
is caving in, wow bam!
you've never been so nuts about a guy
you wanna laugh, you wanna cry
you cross your heart and hope to die
till it's over, and then, shh, shh
it's nice and quiet, shh, shh
but soon again, shh, shh
starts another big riot
you blow a fuse, zing boom
the devil cuts loose, zing boom
so what's the use, wow bam!
of falling in love?
it's oh, so quiet
it's oh, so still
you're all alone
and so peaceful until
you ring the bell, bim bam
you shout and you yell, hi ho-ho
you broke the spell
gee, this is swell, you almost have a fit
this guy is "gorge" and i got hit
there's no mistake, this is it!
till it's over, and then
it's nice and quiet, shh, shh
but soon again, shh, shh
starts another big riot
you blow a fuse, zing boom

so what's the use, wow bam!
of falling in love?
the sky caves in
the devil cuts loose
you blow, blow, blow
blow, blow your fuse, ahh!
when you fall in love
shh

you'll be given love
you'll be taken care of
you'll be given love
you have to trust it
maybe not from the sources
you have poured yours
maybe not from the directions
you are staring at
twist your head around
it's all around you
all is full of love
all around you
all is full of love
you just ain't receiving
all is full of love
your phone is off the hook
all is full of love
your doors are all shut
all is full of love
all is full of love, all

just jump into a lake
and have a go at marmite
flat out
rap it on the ground
i'm going to get trampled
under
footnotch
bump into rocks
and they'll put me in a tree
or something

hear the dull echo
in the soft bark
of a tree that has fallen
hollow-like
like a heart that struggles to complete
it is a mystery why
it takes courage to go up to its trunk
and grab its trunk
and see the dull dull flame
it takes courage to go up to its trunk
and grab its trunk
and take a look
at the dull dull flame
it takes courage to go up to its trunk
and take its trunk
and take a look
at the dull dull flame
it takes courage to go up to its trunk
and take its trunk
and take a look
it takes courage to go up to its trunk
to risk it all?
it takes courage to go up to its trunk
to risk it all?
to risk it all?
take a deep breath
and breathe heavily
we're the guardians of this tree
it takes courage to go up to its trunk
to risk it all?
take a deep breath
and breathe heavily

my throat was stuffed
my mouth was sewn up
banned from making noise
i was not heard
remove this hindrance
my throat feels stuck
i was not allowed
i was not heard
i was not heard
i was not heard
i was not heard
there is vocal sadness
i was separated
from what i can do
what i'm capable of
need to break up
vicious habits
do something i haven't done
i haven't done before
in vow of silence
i explore the negative space
around my mouth
it implodes
black hole
with jaw fallen in
in fallen jaw
jaw fallen in
i am not hurt
i am not hurt

thousands of sounds
i thank this trunk

i have followed a path
that took sacrifices
now i sacrifice this scar
can you cut it off?

one hand
loves the other
so much on me
born stubborn, me
will always be
before you count "1, 2, 3"
i will have grown my own private branch

you, gardener
you, discipliner

i can obey all of your rules
and still be, be

come to me
i'll take care of you
protect you
calm, calm down
you're exhausted
come lie down
you don't have to explain
i understand
you know that i adore you
you know that i love you
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm
jump off
your building's on fire
and i'll catch you
i'll catch you
destroy all that is keeping you down
and then i'll nurse you
i'll nurse you
i'll protect you
you know that i adore you

so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble

i wake up
and the day feels flat
i tilt my head
i'm trying to get an angle
'cause the evening
i've always longed for
it could still happen
how do i master
the perfect day
six glasses of water
seven phone calls
if you leave it alone
it might just happen
anyway
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
well it never really was
it's not up to you
if you wake up
and the day feels a-broken
just lean into the crack
just lean into the crack
and it will tremble
ever so nicely
notice how it sparkles
down there
i can decide
what i give
but it's not up to me
what i get given
unthinkable surprises
about to happen
but what they are
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
well it never really was
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
oh it never really was

there's too much
clinging

there's too much
pressure

she always knows when people need stroking
and is attracted to deathbeds and divorces
i dreamt she cared for my dying grandfather
lying naked face down on his bed
she insists on total presence
and knows how to get through to the rest of us
she has entered

innocence
it is a curse
it is a blessing

there's too much
clinging
to peak
there's too much
pressure
nowhere near here
and if you ever get here
there's gonna be a demand
it will be incredible
if i were you
and wanted to say hi
and complain about how hard it is
i wouldn't be here
how can you complain
about how much you appreciate?
i'm always looking
to make you a better offer
if you ever get here
there's gonna be a demand
there's gonna be a demand
there's gonna be a demand
i'd only ever love you
you're already hurting
i'm already disciplining you
let's just get over it
you're already disgraced
i'm just gonna leave it be
i'm already disciplining you
let's just get over it

i know i've been tolerant 'til now
but here comes a warning
there's a very clear line that i'm drawing
and if you cross it

your third-class communication
and bulldoze over all my sensitivities
you've read me all wrong

a juxtapositioning fate
find our mutual coordinates
moments of clarity are so rare
i better document this
at last the view is fierce
all that matters is
who is open chested
and who has coagulated
who can share and
who has shut down the chances?
show me emotional respect, oh respect, oh respect

all that no one wants

a juxtapositioning fate

moments of clarity are so rare

at last the view is fierce
all that no one wants
in a desolate landscape
hollow
clock the streets are laid waste
all that no one wants
crawling in the dark
desert like me
drown like me
in the water of the mars
my hibernating body
weaking up
day by day
we inch closer
day by day
day by day
until we're kegging out at a party
weezing and dancing
listen how they do at night
when the lights are up, crowing like sky creatures
webb by day and dance
aurora by night

utopia
it's not meant to be like
it could get ugly fast
and then i will be fine
i'm a fountain of blood
in the shape of a girl
you are the boy
i am I
you are the spirit
walking me
hypnotised by the ocean
blood that
====================
maybe he will come out of this
maybe he won't
i'm not taming no animal
maybe he will come out of this
maybe he will come out of this
maybe he will come out of this
maybe he won't
somehow i'm not too bothered either way
somehow i'm not too bothered either way
i refuse, it's a sign of maturity
to be stuck in complexity
i demand all clarity
maybe he will come out of this
or he will feel solitaire
somehow i'm not too bothered
i'd just like to know

all of my mouth was kissing him
now, into the air, i am missing him
is this excess texting a blessing?
two music nerds obsessing
he reminds me of the love in me
i'm celebrating on a vibrancy
sending each other mp3s
falling in love to a song
this handsomest of wickermen
he asked if i could wait for him
now, how many lightyears this interim
while i fall in love with his songs?
his hands are good in protecting me
touching and caressing me
but would it be trespassing
wanting him to be blissing me
robbing him of his youth?
cliffhanger like suspension
my longing has formed its own skeleton
bridging the gap between singletons
sending each others these songs
the interior of these melodies
is perhaps where we are meant to be
our physical union a fantasy
i just fell in love with a song
so, i reserve my own intimacies
i bundle them up in packages
my rawward longing far too visceral
did i just fall in love with love?

i'm a fountain of blood
in the shape of a girl
you're the bird on the brim
hypnotised by the whirl
drink me, make me feel real
wet your beak in the stream
game we're playing is life
love's a two way dream
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a path of cinders
burning under your feet
you're the one who walks me
i'm your one way street
i'm a whisper in the water
secret for you to hear
you're the one who grows distant
when i beckon you near
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a tree that grows hearts
one for each that you take
you're the intruder's hand
i'm the branch that you break

my healed chest wound
transformed into a gate
where i receive love from
where i give love from
and i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
split into many parts
splattered light beams into prisms
that will reunite
if you care for me, care for me
if you care for me, care for me
care for me, care for me
and then i'll care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
didn't used to be so needy
just more broken than normal
proud self-sufficiency
my silhouette is oval
it is a gate
i can care for you, care for you from
i can care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
you care for me, care for me
care for you

shh, shh
it's oh, so quiet, shh, shh
it's oh, so still, shh, shh
you're all alone, shh, shh
and so peaceful until
you fall in love, zing boom
the sky up above, zing boom
is caving in, wow bam!
you've never been so nuts about a guy
you wanna laugh, you wanna cry
you cross your heart and hope to die
till it's over, and then, shh, shh
it's nice and quiet, shh, shh
but soon again, shh, shh
starts another big riot
you blow a fuse, zing boom
the devil cuts loose, zing boom
so what's the use, wow bam!
of falling
====================
i'm strong in his hands, i'm above
and if someone calls me 'dangerous' i'll be 'warm in his hands, warm in mine'
and if someone calls me 'warm in his hands, warm in mine' and if i offer 'warm' i get 'humiliation in my voice'
we're the tribe 'warm up'
don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm
jump off
your building's on fire
and i'll catch you
i'll catch you
destroy all that is keeping you down
and then i'll nurse you
i'll nurse you
you can't say no to hope
can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
i see where you are
it doesn't scare me at all
i see where you are, ooh
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all

i wish i want to stay here
i wish this be enough
i wish i only love you
i wish simplicity
look at the speed out there
it magnetizes me to it
and i have no fear
i'm only into this to
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
i wish i'd only look
and didn't have to touch
i wish i'd only smell this
and didn't have to taste
how can i ignore?
this is sex without touching
i'm going to explore
i'm only into this to
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy

i will wade out till my thighs
are steeped in burning flowers
i will take the sun in my mouth
and leap into the ripe air alive
with closed eyes
to dash against darkness
in the sleeping curves of my body
i shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
with chasteness of seagirls
will i complete the mystery of my flesh?
will i complete the mystery of my flesh, my flesh?

i walk through this land
stake a claim
with my sense
with my bark
mark my nest with song
hear the, the echo, echo from that cliff
i draw laser line through lake
to take physicality
i inhale this physicality
this forest is in me
this forest is in me
i immerse me
this is my home
this is, this is my home

if there is a troubador washing: it is he
if there is a man about town: it is he
if there is one to be sought: it is he
if there are nine she's: they are bought for me
this way is as is she
and he placed her unclothed, long, long, long-legged
on top of the family tree
and if he has chosen the point while she is under him
then leave her coily placed crouched sucking him
for it is i
with her on knee
i leave her without pith or feel
and leave her be
leave it be, for he controls what there'll be
he makes his face known to none
for if he is seen, then all will
and all will know
know me

excuse me
but i just have to
explode
explode this body
off me
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
i'll be brand new
brand new tomorrow
a little bit tired
but brand new
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
ohhhhh!
oaaahh!!!

oh, oh
darling, stop confusing me
with your wishful thinking
hopeful embraces
don't you understand?
i have to go through this
i belong to here where
no one cares, and no one loves
no light no air to live in
a place called hate
the city of fear
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
and the hurt stops
it's sometimes just like sleeping
curling up inside my private tortures
i nestle into pain
hug suffering
caress every ache
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting

like a virus needs a body
as soft tissue feeds on blood
====================
cash in the accounts of the blind?
the blind give form
to magical lights
on either side of town
every house was made of bark
for the blind
the blind walk
blindfolded
visibly happy
to be out of this magical world
how will i stay in it?
the bark is gone, the dancer has left
the trick or the calligraphy
gone, gone, gone
to find the secret of love?
there is no map
there is a sky and a soil
and the first step is making a map
a little compass is all that is needed
to follow the path of the needle
a little compass is all that is needed
a little compass is all that is needed
a little compass is all that is needed
a little compass is all that is needed
a little compass is all that is needed
a little compass is all that is needed
a little compass is all that is needed

one day
it will happen
how do i predict it?
make a prediction
what happens next?
like a virus needs a body
a girl transforms into a boy
he copies DNA
once you renounce your apocalyptic past
you'll grow as a boy
i will protect her from what is ahead
i will protection her from what is yet to be
she will grow as a boy
but as a boy
i will protect her from what is ahead
i will protection her from what is yet to be
she will grow as a boy
and boy
but as a boy
i will protect her from what is ahead
i will protection her from what is yet to be
she will grow as a boy
and boy
but as a boy
i will protect her from what is ahead
i will protection her from what is yet to be
she will grow as a boy
and boy
but as a boy
i will protect her from what is ahead
i will protection her from what is yet to be
she will grow as a boy
and boy
but as a boy
i will protect her from what is ahead
i will protection her from what is yet to be
she will grow as a boy
and boy
but as a boy
i will protect her from what is ahead
i will protection her from what is yet to be

or what?

little ones,aaahh!!!

i'm sending myself scurrying

coincidence
i'm not joking around
this is real life
heating!
we're getting drunk
driving
faster than a shooting
hikers style
without a map
crawling in silence
listen how they shine
in white street clothes
shopping is all and travel is the same
you see the mistakes made
you grow more stubborn
i guide my knife
through the downcast lashes
i see the stubbornness
i see the will
to get out of this bad
lull
it's slippery down my jeans
now pull down my hood
the top has grown back
now crawl into this unknown
surrender to fate
i'm naked and starving
go to the top of the mountain
and pull out a calendar
it shows me months
maybe not years
but years
and months to build a dome
build a dome on top of this volcanic pit

get over the sorrow, girl
the world is always going to be made of this
you can trust in it
unless you breathe in
bravely
i adore how you simply surrender to high
and your lungs, they're mourning
t-b style
all the stillborn love that could've happened
all the moments you should have embraced
all the moments you should have not locked up
understand so clearly:
to shut yourself up
would be the hugest crime of them all
hugest crime of you
you're just crying after all
to not want them humans around
anymore
get over that sorrow, girl
get over it

hollow
my ancestors have access
hollow
i'm falling down the abyss
hollow
looking for some answers
generations of mothers sailing in
somehow they all were shipfolks
hollow
the ground is opening up
swallows me up
the trunk of dna
the trunk of dna, trunk
now come forth, all species
hollow
like a bead in necklace
thread me upon this chain
i'm part of it, ohh
the everlasting necklace
jewels after jewels after jewels after
jewels after jewels after jewels after
jewels after jewels after jewels

there is a view
up on the toe

straight and erect
hungry and curious

the air is thinner here
she came here
to lose face
got down on her knees
the beast is back!
on four legs
set her clock to the moon
raises her spine
vertebrae by vertebrae
up on the toe
looking
i have been filled with steam for months, for years
same old cloud, claustrophobic me
let it burst like old train sounds
make them leave me nature
vertebrae by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
my arms ooze out of my shoulders!
and the arms ooze out of my shoulders
i curl my tail inwards, inwards
i set my clock on the moon
vertebrae by vertebrae
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
let off some steam

what's the point of all this effort if nothing else?
if something doesn't work out?
what's the biggest surprise?

find our mutual coordinates

we live on a mountain
right at the top
there's a beautiful view
from the top of the mountain
every morning i walk towards the edge
and throw little things off
like car parts, bottles and cutlery
or whatever i find lying around
it's become a habit
a way to start the day
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
it's in the air
it says hi
iticates a thing
it's off the table
i'm feeling too motivated
i'm sending my greetings
i'm canceling the activity
off at the wrong place
i'm trying to get the best of you
but it looks like i'm going nowhere
i've been sweating it out
we've been drinking too much
i'm showing signs of recovery
anyway
i'm sending my greetings

why can't you give her room?
respect her spatial needs
i feel you compress her
into a small space
with clairvoyance
she knew what you needed
and she gave it to you
now her desires are repressed
arrows in the flesh
when she, when she found your love
her nature bowed her head
she surrendered
she renounced the world for you
now she’s poisoned by demands
you cannot answer
why this sacrifice?
now she regrets the whole thing
a delayed reaction
when she left her craft voluntarily
for your nest, for your love
did you understand?
appreciate
build a bridge to her
initiate a touch
before it’s too late
say the words to her
that will make her shine
tell her that you love her
your generosity will show
in the volume of her glow
your generosity will show
in the volume of her glow
your generosity will show
in the volume of her glow

i remember you
you're the one that made my dreams come true
a few kisses ago
i remember you
you're the one that said, "i love you too
didn't you know?"
i remember too

while you are away
my heart comes undone
slowly unravels
in a ball of yarn
the devil collects it
with a grin
our love
in a ball of yarn
he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love
he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love
while you are away
my heart comes undone

bird species never seen or heard before
the first flute carved from the first fauna
utopia
it’s not elsewhere
let's purify
you assigned me to protect our lantern
to be intentional about the light
utopia
it isn't elsewhere
it’s here
my instinct has been shouting at me for years
saying, "let’s get out of here!"
huge toxic tumour bulging underneath the ground here
purify, purify, purify, purify toxicity

first snow of winter
i'm walking hills and valleys
adore this mystical fog!
this fucking mist!
these cliffs are just showing off!
then the body memory kicks in
i mime my home mountains
the moss that i'm made of
i redeem myself
i've been wrestling my fate
do i accept this ending?
will i accept my death
or struggle claustrophobic?
fear of nothing, love of nothing
i accept nothing
suffering deprivation
comes to me and i swallow pills
to deal with everything
i've been wrestling my destiny
i've been getting little to eat
losing all of my youth to poverty
malnutrition, osteoporosis
it hasn't happened yeti'm so broke
i can't stand the pain
it doesn't bode well
let's get moving
this undisturbed sandy beach is going to stay that way
i decide what i'm going to do with it
and the next minute i'm walking around town
dear legal enforcer
you've got to feel safe
all that no one sees
they see what i've done
they see what i've become
a million little lights that say, "HI!"
and i can see them, they see what i've become
a million little lights that say, "HI!"
and i can see them, they see what i've become
a million little lights that say, "HI!"
you've got to feel safe
all that no one sees
they see what i've done

you've got to feel safe
all that no one sees

i'm so broken
i can't stand the pain
i'm so broken
i can't stand the pain
i don't understand
you know that i love you
you know that i love you
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm
jump off
your building's on fire
and i'll catch you
i'll catch you
destroy all that is keeping you down
and then i'll nurse you
i'll nurse you
i'll protect you
you know that i love you
you know that i love you
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm

i wake up
and the day feels broken
i tilt my head
i'm trying to get an angle
'cause the evening
i've always longed for
it could still happen
how do i master
the perfect day
six glasses of water
seven phone calls
if you leave it alone
it might just happen
anyway
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
well it never really was
it's not up to you

hollow
like a bead in necklace
thread me upon this chain
i'm part of it, ohh
the everlasting necklace
jewels after jewels after jewels after
jewels after jewels after jewels
i yearn to belong
let me belong
let me belong

up on the toe
there is a view
up on the toe
and the spine
straight and erect
hungry and curious
up on the toe
looking forward to
the air is thinner here
she came here
to lose face
got down on her knees
the beast is back!
on four legs
set her clock to the moon
raises her spine
vertebrae by vertebrae
up on the toe
looking
i have been filled with steam for months, for years
same old cloud, claustrophobic me
let it burst like old train sounds
make them leave me nature
vertebrae by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
my arms ooze out of my shoulders!
and the arms ooze out of my shoulders
i curl my tail inwards, inwards
i set my clock on the moon
vertebrae by vertebrae
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
let off some steam

here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind
here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind
here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind
what's the lesser of two evils
if a suicide bomber made to look pregnant
manages to kill her target or not?
what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if she kills them or dies in vain?
nature has fixed no limits on our hopes
oh, what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if her bump was fake or if it was real?
here's my version of it
eternal whirlwind
i have fostered since childhood
well, i don't care
love is all
i dare to drown
to be proven wrong

when your eyes pause on the ball
that hangs on the third branch from the star
you remember why it is dark
and why it gets light again
the earth, like the heart, slopes in its seat
and, like that, it travels along an elliptical path
drawn into the darkness
an unpolished pearl
in sky-black palm of hand
flickering sun-flame
and then you remember
that you, yourself, you are a light-bearer, a light-bearer
receiving radiance from others
flickering sun-flame
unpolished earth in palm of hand

show me forgiveness
for having lost faith in myself
and let my own interior up
to inferior forces
the shame is endless
but if soon start forgiveness
the girl might live

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
i see who you are
i see who you.... are...

it may not always be so
and i say that if your lips
which i have loved
should touch another's
and your dear strong fingers clutch her heart
as mine in time not far away
as mine in time not far away
as i should guide you, dear
in all directions
and take her hands saying:
always love
always loves
always loves
always loves
always loves
i will guide you
always loves
i will guide you
always loves
always loves
i will help you to your feet
where art Thou when of age
does not bow her head?
when does not bow his head?
when does not bow his head?
when does not bow his head?
i feel no bow
i feel no bow
i feel no bow
i wish to flow
through a shell
that is hidden
out above the water
i stand before it
out of these hidden
things
i have been telling myself
it is coming to
it is coming to this
let's open up: embrace
accept all negativity
and enjoy every bit of you
accept every bit of you
it is time

====================
i'm trying to log better hours
clean plate: tabula rasa for my children
clean plate: chastisement for my failures
let's clean up: break the chain of the fuck-ups of the fathers
it is time: for us women to rise and not just take it lying down
it is time: the world is listening
oh, how i love you
embarrassed to pass this mess over to you
but he led two lives
thought ours was the only one
you are strong
you are strong
you are strong
you're so strong

imagine a future and be in it
feel this incredible nurture, soak it in
your past is on loop—turn it off
see this possible future and be in it
hold fort for love forever
we're just momentary vessels
we're just carrying
trust your head around
guide your stare elsewhere
your love is already waiting
you're already in it
hold fort for love forever
watch me form new nests
weave a matriarchal dome
build a musical scaffolding
between sleep and awake
day and night
between night and day
you say i mirror peoples' missions at them
now you mirror at me who i used to be
what i gave to the world
you've giving back at me
hold fort for love forever

define her abyss
show it respect
then a celestial nest
will grow above
when i'm broken, i am whole
and when i'm whole, i'm broken
our mother's philosophy
it feels like quicksand
and if she sinks
i'm going down with her
locate her black lake
the steam from this pit
will form a cloud
for her to live on
when she's broken, she is whole
and when she's whole, she's broken
our mother's philosophy
it feels like quicksand
and if she sinks
i'm going down with her
hackle this darkness
up to the light
where choreographed oxygen
embroiders the air
when we're broken we are whole
and when we're whole we're broken
we are the siblings of the sun
let's step into this beam
every time you give up
you take away our future
and my continuity and my daughter's
and her daughters
and her daughters
and her daughters

my tear duct clogged
my left eye broken
medicate with warm compress
extract hardened tears
sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
i won't denounce her origin
sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
i won't denounce our origin
i've ducked and dived
like the mother in salomon's tale
to spare our girl
i won't let her get cut in half ever
but it's time to teach her some dignity
sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
i won't denounce our origin
sue me, sue me, sue me, sue me
i won't, i won't denounce our origin
no, i won't
he took it from his father
who took it from his father
who took it from his father
let's break this curse
so it won't fall on our daughter
and her daughter
and her daughter
won't let this sink into her dna
sue me, sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
i won't let you denounce our origin
sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
denounce our origin, no, i won't
can't take her suffer
it's so unfair
the sins of the fathers
they just fucked it all up
we had the best family
we had it all
we had it all in our hands
he just pulled us through the wringer
narcissistic

my throat was stuffed
my mouth was sewn up
banned from making noise
i was not heard
remove this hindrance
my throat feels stuck
i was not allowed
i was not heard
i was not heard
i was not heard
i was not heard
there is vocal sadness
i was separated
from what i can do
what i'm capable of
need to break up
vicious habits
do something i haven't done
i haven't done before
in vow of silence
i explore the negative space
around my mouth
it implodes
black hole
with jaw fallen in
in fallen jaw
jaw fallen in
i am not hurt
i am not hurt
this tunnel has enabled
thousands of sounds
i thank this trunk
noise pipe, noise pipe
i have followed a path
that took sacrifices
now i sacrifice this scar
can you cut it off?

there's too much
clinging

there's too much
pressure

she always knows when people need stroking
and is attracted to deathbeds and divorces
i dreamt she cared for my dying grandfather
lying naked face down on his bed
she insists on total presence
and knows how to get through to the rest of us
she has entered me thousandfold often
and undone knots at my most awkward
music, music loves too
she reaches out to orphans and refugees
embraces them with thermal blankets
her favourite childhood moments
were at a hospital for the disabled
i've seen her offer empathy to widows
she attends funerals of strangers
her strongest memory
is feeding children with leprosy
music heals too
i'm here to defend it

when i spot someone who is same height as you
and goes to same record stores
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
when i hear someone with same accent as yours
asking directions with the same beard as yours
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
isn't it odd?
isn't it peculiar?

shuffling your features
assembling a man
googling love
warming my heart on this log fire of love

i have a recurrent dream
every time i lose my voice
i swallow little glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me
during the nights
they do a trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above my bed
while i'm asleep
my mother and son pour into me
warm glowing oil
into my wide open throat
i have a recurrent dream
every time i feel a hoarseness
i swallow warm glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me, oh
they make me feel so much better
they make me feel better
we have a recurrent dream

what's the lesser of two evils
if a suicide bomber made to look pregnant
manages to kill her target or not?
what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if she kills them or dies in vain?
nature has fixed no limits on our hopes
oh, what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if her bump was fake or if it was real?
here's my version of it
eternal whirlwind
i have fostered since childhood
well, i don't care
love is all
i dare to drown
to be proven wrong

when your eyes pause on the ball
that hangs on the third branch from the star
you remember why it is dark
and why it gets light again
the earth, like all living things, transmutates heat
through a funnel
that leads to the earth's core
where it hibernates
from spring to fall
when you least expect it
you will meet an army of hunter's dna
and dna hunter, hunter's dna
dabba, dabba, dabba!

i have been swimming in low tide for months
catching theosophy here
but there's no way
i can handle the thrill
i can't get into trouble
i had better to do

i've seen her offer courage to strangers
she's the ugly whisper
offering comfort to strangers

and like him, like him
i'm thrown into all places
to document all that i've been through
it must have been really hard
if you ever get close to a human
and human behaviour
it's going to get pretty tricky
if you remember
that you're all alone and
you're trying to make sense of all the noise
you're making up
you just suffered a heart attack
you've never been so broken
and you're trying to make sense of it all
you're just crying
to forget all that's happened
you've been here before me

should i shut up or should i go away?
all that no one sees
there's a beauty about us
we all have found
a little distraction
can't get no information
share what's been hidden
about what's being revealed
there's plenty to see
and find some privacy
right at the heart
of what's being revealed
there's plenty to see

when your eyes pause on the ball
that hangs on the third branch from the star
you remember why it is dark
and why it gets light again
the earth, like the heart, slopes in its seat
and, like that, it travels along an elliptical path
drawn into the darkness
an unpolished pearl
in sky-black palm of hand
flickering sun-flame
and then you remember
that you, yourself, you are a light-bearer, a light-bearer
receiving radiance from others
flickering sun-flame
unpolished earth in palm of hand

show me forgiveness
for having lost faith in myself
and let my own interior up
to inferior forces
the shame is endless
but if soon start forgiveness
the girl might live

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
i see who you are
i see who you.... are...

it may not always be so
and i say that if your lips
which i have loved
should touch another's
and your dear strong fingers clutch her heart
as mine in time not far away
if on another's face your sweet hair lay
in such a silence as i know
or such great writhing words as, uttering overmuch
stand helplessly before the spirit at bay
if this should be, i say if this should be
you of my heart, send me a little word
that i may go unto her, and take her hands saying
accept all happiness from me
then i shall turn my face
and hear one bird sing terribly afar in the lost lands

when will it be time to document?
do it now!
this submarine behaviour
do it now!
when time?

====================
i'm a fountain of blood
in the shape of a girl
you're the bird on the brim
hypnotised by the whirl
drink me, make me feel real
wet your beak in the stream
game we're playing is life
love's a two way dream
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a path of cinders
burning under your feet
you're the one who walks me
i'm your one way street
i'm a whisper in the water
secret for you to hear
you're the one who grows distant
when i beckon you near
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a tree that grows hearts
one for each that you take
you're the intruder's hand
i'm the branch that you break

my healed chest wound
transformed into a gate
where i receive love from
where i give love from
and i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
split into many parts
splattered light beams into prisms
that will reunite
if you care for me, care for me
if you care for me, care for me
care for me, care for me
and then i'll care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
didn't used to be so needy
just more broken than normal
proud self-sufficiency
my silhouette is oval
it is a gate
i can care for you, care for you from
i can care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
you care for me, care for me
care for you

shh, shh
it's oh, so quiet, shh, shh
it's oh, so still, shh, shh
you're all alone, shh, shh
and so peaceful until
you fall in love, zing boom
the sky up above, zing boom
is caving in, wow bam!
you've never been so nuts about a guy
you wanna laugh, you wanna cry
you cross your heart and hope to die
till it's over, and then, shh, shh
it's nice and quiet, shh, shh
but soon again, shh, shh
starts another big riot
you blow a fuse, zing boom
the devil cuts loose, zing boom
so what's the use, wow bam!
of falling in love?
it's oh, so quiet
it's oh, so still
you're all alone
and so peaceful until
you ring the bell, bim bam
you shout and you yell, hi ho-ho
you broke the spell
gee, this is swell, you almost have a fit
this guy is "gorge" and i got hit
there's no mistake, this is it!
till it's over, and then
it's nice and quiet, shh, shh
but soon again, shh, shh

the sky caves in
the devil cuts loose
you blow, blow, blow
blow, blow your fuse, ahh!
when you fall in love
shh

you'll be given love
you'll be taken care of
you'll be given love
you have to trust it
maybe not from the sources
you have poured yours
maybe not from the directions
you are staring at
twist your head around
it's all around you
all is full of love
all around you
all is full of love
you just ain't receiving
all is full of love
your phone is off the hook
all is full of love
your doors are all shut
all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love

you know that there's more to life?
you know that there's more to life than this?
you know that there's more to life?
we could nick a boat
for our little ghetto party
there's more to life than this
you know that there's more to life than this?
you know that there's more to life?
you know that there's more to life than this?
you know that there's more to life?
there's more to life than this
you know that there's more to life than this?
you know that there's more to life?
you know that there's more to life than this?
you know that there's more to life?

bærinn minn
bærinn minn og þinn
sefur sæll í kyrrð
fellur mjöll
hljótt í húmi á fráð
grasið mitt
grasið mitt og þitt
geymir mold til vors
hjúfrar lind
leynt við brekkurót
vakir eins og við
lífi trútt
kyrrlátt kalda vermsl
augum djúps
utí himinfyrrð
starir stillt um nótt
langt í burt
vakir veröld stór
grimmum töfrum tryllt
eirðarlaus
ottast nótt og dag
augu þín
ottalaus og hrein
brosa við mér björt
vonin mín
blessað brosið þitt
vekur ljóð úr værð
hvílist jörð
hljóð í örmum snæs
liljuhvít
lokar augum blám
litla stúlkan mín

i have a recurrent dream
every time i lose my voice
i swallow little glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me
during the nights
they do a trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above my bed
while i'm asleep
my mother and son pour into me
warm glowing oil
into my wide open throat
i have a recurrent dream
every time i feel a hoarseness
i swallow warm glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me, oh
they make me feel so much better
they make me feel better
we have a recurrent dream
every time we lose our voices
we dream we swallow little lights
our mother and son bakes for us
during the nights
they do a little trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above our heads
while we're asleep
my mother and son pour into us
pour into us
warm glowing oil
into our wide open throats
i have a recurrent dream
they make me feel better
they make me feel better

i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is
====================
