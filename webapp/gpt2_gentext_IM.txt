all the good things that happened to me in high school
all the bad things that happened to me in college
all the things that i've done and done again
i've done three things in a row
i'm a long way from home
early retirement is a dream, not a reality
a grueling drive home from school
early retirement is a nightmare, not a reality
a nightmare i retrace, a grueling drive home

i wish i could leave no trace
but all the memories of high school are left behind
trying to erase all the bad memories
but all the bad memories are too late
why am i being recorded?
why is my name being talked about?
what is my right to be forgotten?
what is my right to be forgotten?
a nightmare has taken its toll on me
a nightmare has taken its toll on the night
a grueling drive home from school
early death has taken its toll on me
a nightmare has taken its toll on the night
a grueling drive home from school
after school everyone's lost their way and is running free
i try to make contact with the outside world
but all i hear is the rusting of leaves
and the rats crawl through the hall
oh, i'm running free just like the rats in the barn
oh, i'm running free just like the rats in the barn
like a dog that's been led astray
oh, i'm running free just like the rats in the barn
like a dog that's been led astray
like a killer that's done the work
but inside i'm scared to reveal
i'm the assassin's breed
i'm the name on the back
i'm the assassin's breed
i'm the name on the back
not a man to be messed with
rape of the earth, you'll find it all too familiar
the telegraph line is a bloody rededick pole
and the harvester's got his thunderous show
you're taking his money, you're taking his life
you're taking his money, you're taking his life
but the mariner's gone, you've gotta find another way
you're taking his money, you're taking his life
there's no place to hide if you want to
you're taking his money, you're taking his life
there's no place to hide if you want to
you're taking his money, you're taking his life
there's no place to hide if you want to
you're taking his money, you're taking his life
there's no place to hide if you want to
you're taking his money, you're taking his life
there's no place to hide if you want to
you're taking his money, you're taking his life
there's no place to hide if you want to
you're taking his money, you're taking his life
there's no place to hide if you want to
you're taking his money, you're taking his life
there's no place to hide if you want to
you're taking his money, you're taking his life
there's no place to hide if you want to
you're taking his money, you're taking his life
there's no place to hide if you want to
you're taking his money, you're taking his life
there's no place to hide if you want to
you're taking his money, you're taking his life...
you're taking his money, you're taking his life...
you're taking his money, you're taking his life, don't you know what you're getting
? 'cause you're young and you're acting like fools
you're acting like a fool
you're acting like a fool
you're acting like a fool
you're acting like a fool
you're acting like a fool
you're acting like a fool
you're acting like a fool
you're acting like a fool
you're acting like a fool
you're acting like a fool
you're acting like a fool
you're acting like a fool in the heat of the morning
when your day is still dawning
and your bird, she's singing
catch your soul, he's willing to fly away
in the dead of the night
the cry is getting louder
and the dead man's gone
white flags shot to ribbons
the oath is being broken
you're taking his life, you're loading him with love
you're loading him with love, but nobody's got the heart to carry it out
you're taking his life, you're loading him with love
but nobody cares
you're loading him with love, you just let him die
you're loading him with love, but nobody's got the heart to carry it out
you're loading him with love, you

and you know, i mean it
it really makes sense, i mean it
how could it have come to this?
the world was meant to be his paradise, died on the cross
mesad and mary was born into a corner
and now they've taken all our prayers for granted
and we await the day when they take our land
the sign of the cross
the name of the rose
a fire in the sky
the sign of the cross

dead man, draw your scythe
now it's getting close to dying
the force pulls the power
its fury the creatures that live in the dark
the light is coming for you, but you're not gonna win
you're gonna die a
====================
love's a secret and men always know
we all got to try the black bart blues
i know you'd have gone insane if you saw what i saw
so now i've got to look for sanctuary from the law
i knew it would be a long road to recovery but it's come a long way and i'm finally here
i got to tell you a thing or two
i'm a big girl and i'm going fast
i'm going fast, i'm going fast
i'm going fast, i'm going fast
oh, i'm a girl who watches men go
i'm a girl who watches men go
i'm a girl who watches men who like it
i'm a girl who watches men who like it
but she always cheats, runs away, lied to everyone
and you think she's nice
because you see her smile
everybody respects her
but she always cheats, runs away, lied to everyone
and you think she's nice
cause you see her smile
everybody respects her
but she always cheats, runs away, lied to everyone
and you think she's nice
cause you see her smile
everybody respects her
but she always cheats, runs away, lied to everyone's waiting for something to happen
they're waiting in long lines for the chance to happen
everyone's waiting in long lines for the chance to happen
everyone's waiting in long lines for the chance to happen
everyone's waiting in long lines for the chance to occur
everyone's waiting in long lines for the chance to occur
everyone's waiting in long lines for the chance to occur
everyone's waiting in long lines for the chance to occur
everyone's waiting in long lines for the chance to occur
everyone's waiting in long lines for the chance to occur
everyone's waiting in long lines for the chance to respond
everyone's waiting in long lines as the demon in the mirror begins to read his mind
he sees a vision but doesn't know which way to turn
he tries to make his own decisions but the one thing he has
that he's good at is the dark side
he casts a shadow on the world by the wayside
he lies to himself and others to make them all pay for his sins
the doctor's sitting at the table waiting for him
an angry scar starts to appear in the morning
a bloated man tries to choke you
a gypsy boy tells you he's for real
a lunatic will die the old man once
at the gates of dawn the armies of light will fall
a silhouette looms ahead
a fireball slumbers for three hours
a prisoner's body is hung with shame
a light goes on and on and on and on and on and on
until the night falls, the hunger and the pain
a ghostly hand reaches through the veil
until the day it falls, the light's still the same
rivers flow with blood
the dying kiss of death are whispered
and the lives of a thousand souls are scarred
and the legend of the great parakeet falls

open the can of worms and i'll tell you about
the experience
being alive on the outside but inside
being alive on the inside
the inside of the can of worms
and the curse
breaking the will to live
murder for vengeance, or murder for gain
for the stain of treason
the name of the game is the honour
ahead of the game, the cunning animal
plenty wise, many enough to play
the game of hide and seek, and the mask of the true
the ending is near, and with it, the coat of honour
and the respect and comfort of a lifetime
go help the dying fight for
the living breathing are lifted by the spell
the ending is near, and with it, the coat of honour
and the respect and comfort of a lifetime
go help the dying fight for
the living breathing are lifted by the spell

====================
"don't waste your time waiting for tomorrow"
we are the shadows of the one unholy ghost
rising from the earth's surface
spirits, unknown
are flashing in the dark
there's a clash of armies
the fire is burning and the wings are torn
be prepared to lose your head
for the fireball is burning bright
the body is lying lifeless on the ground
across the street is a young woman
the fireball is burning bright
she appears to be in her thirties
years she goes without saying
don't know if she's really
transitioning now
she may just be turning pro
maybe this is the first time
she finds
her femininity
transitioning now
she has the confidence to run
she tries to run but
she's getting tired
maybe now she has the courage
to face up with the demon
the mentor is a shadow on the ground
his face seems so cold now
nothing that she can see
she can't help but feel
i’m running
she’s getting nowhere
“sitting in silence
throwing down a blow
she can’t get enough of him
i’m feeling so powerless
she must be running away
she shouldn’t be so worried
the demon’s coming
he slams the door behind her
she tries to run away
but he's overpowered
she's getting so near he can break free
“sitting in silence
the demon’s coming
he slams the door behind her
she's got the power
she can’t go on like that
she can't prevent the demons from coming
she's got the power
she can’t prevent the demons from coming
the demon’s dark laughter comes on top
the macedonian for "godfather"
holy smoke, holy rock
what’s the matter godfather?
mother earth, holy smoke
mother earth, holy smoke
what’s the matter godfather?
mother earth, holy smoke
mother earth, holy smoke
what’s the matter godfather?
mother earth, holy smoke
mother earth, holy smoke
what’s the matter godfather?
mother earth, holy smoke
mother earth, holy smoke
what’s the matter godfather?
everybody's gonna find it
ah-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah-ah
when the priest comes to read me the last rites
i take a look through the bars at the last sights
of a world that’s white with anger
of cold as the sun
has ascended
and the lips of ice are torn
and i’m feeling so alone
and wondering what the hell i can do
nothing that i can contemplate
i'm running and hiding in my dreams
ah-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah-ah
nothing that i can contemplate
nothing that i can contemplate
watching people die
feeling the panic set in
watching the world turning inside out
watching people die
revenge victims falling
falling down
falling down
falling down
the only thing that i have
that’s any particular intention
i'm running from here or hereafter
well, that’s a very personal matter
you never really know
though i'm running out of my time
i'm running out of breath
and imagining the deluge
or the flooding of the land
or the fighting with famine and dragoons

or the going into a cauldron of evil
or the killing of the best ape
you get the feeling that your time will never come
you're running out of breath
and imagining the torment
orison coming soon
the cauldron of evil is ready and waiting
she lays in bed at night
trying to wake her brain
but she's waking in the morning
with a hangover from the fighting
she tries to force a smile
the day she'll be happy and healthy
the demon in the corner of her eye
just won't let her go
she's running from here to there
she always tries to set the world on a false sense
she's trying to get closer to the devil
she's become her own symbol
she wants to be free
she's running away from this place
what she wants is for the world to know what is right
for the victims to know what is right
for the dictators to know what is wrong
for the people to see what is right
for the cauldron of evil to make a pomegranate out of you
i'm running from here to there
i'm never going back
i'm running from hereafter
i'm never going back
never

eating the flies and the rats
but the curse is still on our door
can we let it slip by?
and expect our children to follow
don't they know that they can go on?
when you are walking a dark road
you expect the same from the blind men
you think that by the way they laugh?

the birds are calling your name
the mist is falling
your footsteps will be heard around the campfire
the first rays of the morning sun
fall in love with the greenery
the camp is rue de feu
in the village they call their name
the greenery is growing strong
the sun is shining
the summers are still burning
behind the tree is a rat
become a recluse, swapping clothes for the night
fly like a fish in a barrel of rain
numbing your nerves, turning you into a zombie
the bugle sounds, the barrel fills
but on this battlefield, you can count
your real strength on one hand
and on this one, you must win
the battle, you must win
is lost in translation, but still bloody funny
the greenery grows and the rats they fly
the grass is bleeding, the dead bodies pile up
on this battlefield, you can count
your real strength on one hand
and on this one, you must win
the battle, you must win
the rat race starts again
the smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
he's getting close to getting to knowing
but he's getting nowhere
he's burning himself up
into a ball
he's burning his own gas
you tell me now what are we fighting for?
the battle, you must win
the battle, you must win
the battle, you must win
the battle, you must win

keep your distance, walk away, don't say a word
don't tell me you feel any different
don't you feel a little strange, a little strange
when you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
and you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
i've been dancing with the dead for years
know when you've been crying
know when you've been running
and now you're here
being tortured by your own demons
when you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
and you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
i've been dancing with the dead for years

you'll be coming back, again
don't try and dig any more conclusions
the things that you've done are just too plain
to throw out the baby in the air

he has the power to heal the sick
he has the power to heal the divisions
he's the ruler of the heavens and the earth
you rule over everything
you and me, we'll take the cake

one hundred years later
there is still life to plant and to breed
mystery man, grey wolf, how long have you been here?
four leagues and ten and i'm still here
nothing there to do but stare
wonder if i'm ever gonna find my dad again
i'm coming back to try again
when i'm near sure of it, i'll take what i've got
and tear the world apart
but still, i am destined to live

you die, you live again
now the wolves are gone
the kings of gold
the jellied brains of sale
through the eyes of a fool
you died, you lived
2,000 years, i'm running out
i've waited that long since i was young
all my life i've wondered
where will i end?
i was the son of a bitch
i was called a name that i heard
i was born a whore
and now i've lost my humanity
over the wolves and the time
they've taken our land
lost our culture
and havoc it wreaks
the wolves are coming

the biggest fight you'll ever see
a thousand deaths
one world war i make a fist out of hooks
i cut the heads off of the coxswain
cut off their heads and skinned them too
espoused them in a flash
you made a trench and i filled it

espoused them in a flash
you made a trench and i filled it
the fighting began again
the coxswain died
axes grind and hooks slammed in his bed
he'd like to lay there and stare at the ceiling
but you know that there's nothing but death below
take his money and carry on
the fighting resumes
a heavy metal drum beat begins
the coxswain dies
axes grind and hooks slammed in his bed
he'd like to lay there and stare at the ceiling
but

he was a trouble maker, he'd bark orders
but when he got to his jousts, he'd be nailing it
i remember it well, he was way off the beaten path
took a tumble, he fell over a few feet
oh, oh, i'm on my knees beside you

took a tumble, he fell over a few feet
oh, oh, i'm on my knees beside you

====================
as the night goes on and the deeds of man's know ledge a meeting place for all your darkest secrets
the souls of those who remain will be revealed
hear the voice again, again the souls of those who were
hear the voice again the souls of those who were
when the angel of death came to give his grace to the blind man
the piper at the gates of dawn was calling his call
the night was choking with the nightfall
angel of death spoke with the tongue of a liar
angel of death spoke with a curse
angel of death spoke with a death's lash
hear the voice again, again the souls of those who were
hear the voice again the souls of those who were
when the angel of death came to give his grace to the blind man
the piper at the gates of dawn was giving his grace
to the blind man's bidding
he heard the dying sound of the desert sandals
living in a time when death was a reality
when the titanic roar of the battlecruiser
cried aloud from book of souls
to stand and fight for the honour
of beating the dead
that is their right
to stand and fight for the glory
of dying and begetting immortality
sliding we go
only fear on our side
to the edge of the wire
and we rush with the tide
oh, the water is red
with the blood of the dead
but i'm still alive
pray to god i survive
how long, on this longest day
'till we finally make it through?
how long, on this longest day
'till we finally make it through?
how long, on this longest day
'till we finally make it through?
the rising dead hoards of souls, floating on the blood of the dead
the rising dead, they are damned souls

but they are still alive, floating on the blood of the dead
they are damned souls, you are supposed to be a saint
i am a martyr, a son of a a aching thigh
i am a saint, but i'm not a priest
and when you are praying to be saved
you are praying in a foreign land
you are a prisoner, a fellow soldier
you are a burden on the of the devil
you are thrust into the light, a martyr for mankind
a burden that you can't escape
so why are you standing there waiting for me to come back?
thinking about all the things that have gone wrong the last two weeks
but also thinking about the things that you'll never be forgiven
wanting vengeance, money, glory
wanting, fear, glory
wanting, fear, glory
wanting, fear, glory
wanting, fear, glory
so why are you standing there waiting for me to come back?
feeling a little anxious, but also a little scared
wanting to be free, but also a burden on the devil
saints and sinners, holy men and angels
it is you, my christ, i'll be your body
your soul, i'll be yours forever
the priest looks at me and says:
charlotte, you're not so sure
charlotte, you think i'm vain
you think i'm crazy
you think i'm crazy
charlotte, you think i'm a fool
you think i'm crazy
charlotte, you're not so sure
charlotte, you think i'm vain
you think i'm vain
you think i'm crazy
charlotte, you're not so sure
that the devil's watching you
giving you a squeeze of love in your veins
you're sure you'll get it all, angels!
angel of the east, the eastern coast
the ferryman has asked:
"demons out, are you guys ready?
galloping, gathering speed
the ship is in the air
everyone's shouting, "get on the line!"
over the hill, a fireball is burning
peeling the sky
melting the rocks
and the hull is in pieces
singing in the dark
over the ocean, a ship is sinking
you pray for her, she doesn't respond
you pray for her, she doesn't know she's sinking
you pray for her, she doesn't respond
over the hills, a ship is sinking
tears fall in the sea
but on this day, tears are shed
and the demons that sheies prowl
the light of the mariner is gone
damnation in the mariner's eyes
the mariner's ailing and the spirits clean
on this journey, no faith and no belief
the mariner's ailing and the spirits clean
on this journey, no faith and no belief
safe passage for you and me

====================
you know you can count
too well on my knife
too well on my stick
i'm never gonna let you go
you're gonna stab me to death
knock on wood, you're gonna stab me to death
so, stab me to death, stab me to death
blood on the stones, the name of the river
with your boots on
you've got to try to break free
you can't help but feel trapped
i've just got to clear my head
but i'm not gonna let go
i've just got to clear my mind
but i'm not gonna let go
so, stab me to death, i'm running free
so, stab me to death, stab me to death
oh, stab me to death, i'm running free
so, stab me to death, i'm running free
oh, stab me to death, i'm running free
oh, stab me to death, i'm running free
you're the first to die, you survive
death is like a knife and a stick
survivors are like a razor, but without the use of a razor
it would be a deadly error
to carry on with life, i'm running free
so, stab me to death, i'm running free
oh, stab me to death, i'm running free
so, stab me to death, i'm running free
so, stab me to death, i'm running free
oh, stab me to death, i'm running free
oh, stab me to death, i'm running free
so, stab me to death, i'm running free
oh, stab me to death, i'm running free
so, stab me to death, i'm running free
oh, stab me to death, i'm running free
so, stab me to death, i'm running free
there were times when i was afraid to say no
when you were running free, how could you be such a swine man
when you didn't know what was coming next
i had the feeling that my life would be the end
when you told me that i would die
i didn't want anyone to know about that
that night i was running free
and by the grace of god's grace
i would not only be free, i would be blessed
and i would be a race among men
to the land of the free
oh, behold the power that be is laughing and how it laughs in heaven
that's the sound that comes to my mind
when i think back to that night
what i have learned as a person
and as a person of interest to the law
oh, oh, i'm a preacher
and as a person
i like things that are out of control
heaven can be your friend, but hell is your enemy
you'll find he'll be a hundred times more fearsome
than the wolf that you see every night
burning on about to come to rest
but as soon as you're close to him
he'll be burning as his house is about to burst
you'd better get ready for what's to come
the wolf will be burning here in heaven
hell can be expected from heaven
hell is prepared for what's to come
but as soon as you're ready for it
damned for all eternity
only the fools who would have died
would have died
would have died
at the gates and on the walls
of heaven will fall the punishment
for the rest will be hell
only the fools who would have died
would have died
at the gates and on the walls
of heaven will fall the punishment
for the rest will be hell
only the fools who would have died
would have died
at the gates and on the walls
of heaven will fall the punishment
for the rest will be hell
only the fools who would have died
would have died
at the gates and on the walls

====================
by accident, the two of them fell from grace, falling from grace
their fall came at last, a curse has begun, a curse has begun
fall, the beast is rising again, the cry is echoing
with every step one slips into another
his fragile ego torn, his soul's wreckage
the final straw, the torture begins

i stand alone in the tower, pray to god i will not fall
as they search the grounds for the bodies
i feel they've found the one, the only way
they search the grounds for the bodies, but no-one's found their bodies
as the guards march them to the ground
as the scream of pain fills the air
they are outnumbered, the death throes go on
i pray they'll be saved, i pray they'll be saved
by fire and blood, hoping no-one's harmed
by the time they reach the bridge
they've split into two
blood on my hands, blood on my mind
blood on my lips, no-one's healed
as they march them to the ground
as the scream of pain fills the air
they are outnumbered, the death throes go on
i pray they'll be saved, i pray they'll be saved
by fire and blood, hoping no-one's harmed
by the time they reach the bridge
they've split into two
blood on my hands, blood on my mind
blood on my lips, no-one's healed
as they march them to the ground
as the scream of pain fills the air
they are outnumbered, the death throes go on
i pray they'll be saved, i pray they'll be saved
by fire and blood, hoping no-one's harmed
by the time they reach the bridge
they've split into two
blood on my hands, blood on my mind
blood on my lips, no-one's healed
as they march them to the ground
as the scream of pain fills the air
they are outnumbered, the death throes go on
i pray they'll be saved, i pray they'll be saved
by fire and blood, hoping no-one's damaged

====================
from the swamps to the lakeside
to ride the waves and wave goodbye
the river runs deep and the waves
chill the hearts and souls of riders
every rider has a passing interest
but every now and then someone
lost his/her mind and never come back
saints and sinners
a mover and shank in a ship
the murrayed leaves redolent of glory
hear the murrayed voice again
murrayed again, with anger and ire
in a galaxy far, far away
if we could fly a craft
and send them back to their home planets
would we all be blessed
and free our people from the chains of yoke
and replace them with the mighty?
take the reigns, the falls
anointed the new kings
a new religion promulgating overlord
lord above all is lord
the sun is set, the phases of creation
time to rise and fall
rise and fall as the phases of the moon, which were once held in high places
have fallen and are falling
as the phases of the moon, which were once held in high places
we rise from the dead
as one with the dead
i'm coming back from the dead
with a vengeance
for all the sins you can commit
you were never meant to be here
i'm coming back from the dead
with a vengeance
for all the sins you can commit
you were never meant to be here
i'm coming back from the dead
with a vengeance
for all the sins you can commit
you were never meant to be here
i'm coming back from the dead
with a vengeance
for all the sins you can commit
you were never meant to be here
i'm coming back from the dead
with a vengeance
for all the sins you can commit
you were never meant to be here
i'm coming back from the dead
with a vengeance
for all the sins you can commit
you were never meant to be here
i'm coming back from the dead
with a vengeance
for all the sins you can commit
you were never meant to be here
i'm coming back from the dead
with a vengeance
for all the sins you can commit
you were never meant to be here
so they put the statue up?
and the sword in their belt?
and the gatherer's life is done
they let him go but they keep him in their sights
and they keep him in their thoughts
and they keep him in their prayers i'm running and hiding in my dreams
but all the while they stare at me
out in the night the room goes on
knocking on the window is making
seeing the walls turn to dust as i'm digging
i'm running from my demons
inside i whisper to myself
please god help me if i go
is it in your power to forgive?
pray to god it's not
killing the soul you fear is your life
inside your thoughts are spinning
i'm burning at the stake
if i survive the night
i will go down in history as a martyr
if not for the martyrdom of lust
if not for the lust of arouse
i'll be damned as well
for the sinner's name is burnt
the name of the old man is blaspheming
brought shame to the land of the free
by the power of men
by the will of a man
by the power of a man
by the man i am
i'm running from my demons
inside i whisper to myself
please god help me if i go
is it in your power to forgive?
pray to god it's not
killing the soul you fear is your life

by the power of men
by the power of a man
by the man i am
i'm running from my demons
inside i whisper to myself
please god help me if i go
is it in your power to forgive?
pray to god it's not
killing the soul you fear is your life
by the power of men
by the power of a man
by the man i am
i'm running from my demons the cauldron full of blood
the killing field ever ready to pierce
the skin of the lance laid on the ground
one by one the dead spears
spread like the fires of the sun
sunrise in the dead of the valley
see the blood quiver twist as i stand before the cross
what will you think of the black?
will you be a person or will you be an egg?
one by one the body is removed
from the skin of the lance
and upon my forehead is placed the life egg
life after the earth
for the first time in ages
i feel alive again
life goes on and on
====================
numbing our desires
watching politicians play
debate
selling our soldiers
killing our sons
supplies are running short
we must end the slaughter
we must end the martial law
then a phalanx of phalanx
plenty many, many colours
for the first time in 3,000 years
the phalanx move in behind us
and begin to tear at our hearts
the walls of gold
she walks us through the city
she tells us of his memory
she holds his trophies
all of them hidden away
she has his blood on her hands
make her an offer we can make
she'll tear it up indeed
you tell me what life is
you tell me what love is
but i't know what to do
take my eyes away guys, they're getting lonely
girls looking for love are all lonely

hooks are lying in wait as they lay in wait for the perfect moment
for the end of the world
end of the race
the final frontier
a razor blade in a teardrop
you die as you lived your life
there are secrets that you kept
but i know you don't know them
i've been looking so long for you, you know i'm going fast
i want to take you on a ride
the ending of time
that you will never see
that you will forever be attached
to the ending of time
that you will forever be attached
i want to bring you all closer
i want to bring you all closer
i want to bring you all closer
i want to bring you all closer when you were sleeping
i heard the sirens of the cities
and the sirens of the sirens
call to arms
to defend your home
against the invading army
you saved me from myself
i am drifting far away
when you're sleeping
i dream of the cities
and the sirens of the fighting
when you're sleeping

called upon by the angel of the east
to defend the island
from the east
i am drifting
out of the sun
i am lost without trace
i am a lost soul lost in a sea of madness
i am lost and
====================
mem'ries rising in the dark
there's a chance i may be dead
there's a chance that i may be alive
there's a chance that i may be dead
tell me why i must
tell me why i must
i am a wanderer
but i have no memory of what i see
afraid to call it a day
afraid to think that i'm just a phantom
afraid to look into the eyes of the man
afraid to pray that i won't fall
afraid to pray that i will be free
afraid to go looking for the reason why
i do this for the love of god
for i am a merchantman
and i am a merchantman
not a mugger, i kill that
for i am a merchantman

what you seeing, do you really want?
can you give me some, just a word of warning?
can you give me some of the love i thirst?
the loneliness of an unbroken line
when you can't find the love you so craves
why can't i fight off the raging lust?

the good and the bad
where the good and the
bad stand
the good and the bad
when you see the smile
the lips turn red
the anger and the pain
a look of sadness and a pain
never one to be derided
done all our best to make you feel
it's only a game, after all
and you've got to win to stay alive
the clock is fast, the rounds to come
the whistle blows and the rounds become one
who will be born who will inherit the house
the old ways are black and burning
with the sun don't let them take you alive
the clock is going down, the rounds to come
the whistle blows and the rounds become one
who will be born who will take the throne
the old ways are black and burning
with the sun don't let them take you alive
the clock is going down, the rounds to come
the whistle blows and the rounds become one
who will be born who will take the throne
the good and the bad
who will be born who will take the throne
now there's nothing left that can be done
you stand alone, with nothing to hide
you're taken from the fight, gone
repeat offenders
no point to point the argument
you pull up beside monsters the scream is rising
and i know of the pain
that you feel the pain, i'll come back
no point to point the argument
you stand alone, with nothing to hide
you're taken from the fight, gone
repeat offenders

took me to the ground I felt my soul began to die
took me to the brink of insanity
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
when the angel of the east spoke to me
and told me that they had promised me their lives and that theywould show me their blood
the angel of the east spoke to me and told me that they had died and thattheywould bring me good news
of a better life than death itself
when the two of me became the only ones
i took them both away from the line
then the angel of the east
asked me why i sometimes feel scared but alive
i shouldn't i say i'm not a danger
but a life that's held so dear
took me to the ground that scared the shit out of me
and i know what i want
i'll take you on a ride
a journey that will leave no one behind
the fear that you feel when you see the light of the morning
the fear that you think you've lost your mind
the fear that you take your eyes from the dark
and stare into the light of the morning
when you look into the eyes of the one who's unseen
will be revealed
the mystery that you seek is revealed
the power that you have
your destiny, your way
you'll be sent to hell before you even begin
so understand that knowing your destiny
can be a burden to let go
but knowing that you can take no other path
when you look into their eyes
you'll be led astray
don't you know that the way you see the world
is not all the more strange
i've looked into the heart of darkness
where the path leads
you'll find meekness that I find hard to deny
the loneliness that's inside the hunger
i've looked into the heart of darkness
where the path leads
you'll find meekness that i find hard to deny
the loneliness that's inside the hunger
the loneliness that's inside the hunger
there are secrets that you keep
there are secrets that you keep
there are secrets that you tell to me alone
i can't reach things i can't see
you don't see this strange world quite the same as me
don't deny me what i am
i am not afraid of dying
make my presence known to the world
relive

the final frontier
when you look into their eyes
you'll be led astray

we had a long and winding road, and then the battle began
and the news spread all around the camp
all about us was brought to no avail
and as the sun rose on the mountain
it was sad to see the bodies lay
all around us were burned survivors
all of us had our throats cut or died
somehow we managed to save our skins
and i am so sad

ooh, it was fun
getting across the finish line was a real thrill
the music played, the words were said
and then a wave of the hand came crashing down
and i felt something push against me
and then i rushed to the scene of the crime

so here we are, enter here, enter here
oh, i just want to know what you're thinking
and see what i'm thinking
when you're in your deepest thoughts
there's nothing but love in your eyes
you seem to be drifting back a little
i've never felt so trapped
thought i'm floating back a little
but i'm on my own
i'm on my own 'til somebody better tells me the truth
i'm on my own till somebody better tells me the truth
oh, yeah!
oh, yeah!
oh, yeah!
oh, yeah!
oh, yeah!
oh, yeah!
ooh, yeah!
say it doesn't matter, say it doesn't matter
and don't try and put any number into my head
there's got to be just one truth
and it's got to do with the very nature of things
and it's got to do with the nature of thoughts
and it's got to do with the nature of feelings
and it's got to do with the nature of the mind
and it's got to do with the nature of the emotions
and it's got to do with the nature of the minds
when you're floating back a little bit
i've never felt so free
until i'm walking around
and the mirror's shining
i've no feelings
but i'm moving even closer
is it the first time you've ever felt that way?
and the sound of my guitar playing on the wind
of the distant voices that call down the call
oh, listen to what she says
hear what she says
when you're floating back a little bit
i've never felt so free
until i'm walking around
and the mirror's shining
i've no feelings
but i'm moving even closer

====================
a madman finds his way into the heart of the law
the perfect storm that will make him pay for what he's done
a gallows man, a martyr for the law
a genius for the law a seething tyrant
his blood is running high as he's deciding which path to take
a preacher of damnation cuts the devil from his heart
a banker's nightmare i tell you
the rich man always make the mistakes
the state of affairs it's all or nothing
the end of the world is here
or will the bullet point just be enough?
as the banker who mistook a cut to the chest for a stab takes his money
the killing has gone on and on and on and on and on and on at the scene of the crime
the body bags and bloody clothes that were left behind
the killer must be going crazy or is he?
there has to be a way
the rich man always make the mistakes
the end of the world is here
or will the bullet point just be enough?

as the assassin who mistook a cut to the chest for a stab takes his money
the killer has gone insane and the crime is unsolved
you're driving a pickup truck and you see a bus full of people
it's hard to believe but it's true
and now it's evident
because of the way you driving
you could easily be strolling
on foot to the door
carrying a bag over your head
but that's not the point
you're not carrying with you
a piper at the western edge of town
you're flying a flag
and it's hurting our mood
the bus is late for work and we're having a hard time
please tell me now what day it's?
yes, day it's
writhing in the sun
tears of a clown
you've got to try to make sense
maybe it will be the last time
yes, day it's
time to go to war
no talk of a war
the timing of our entry into this war
must be spot on for all of us
the moment has come for us all
we are the rulers of the earth
and the jaws of death shall drop into the ocean
no talk of a war
the timing of our entry into this war
must be spot on for all of us
for the night we have to live in fear
and sleepless nights since we've been born
listen for the raven’s call
keep you and your promises
the raven’s call
keep you and your promises
we are the rulers of the earth
and the jaws of death shall drop into the ocean
no talk of a war
the timing of our entry into this war

the killer's in the sea
the boat is swifter than a ship
the waves are weaker
our ships are rusting
the hull is sagging
the captain's son
hear his old man talk
what he said
listen for the raven’s call
keep you and your promises
the raven’s call
keep you and your promises
we are the rulers of the earth

and i'd like to know what you think
what do you think you'd like to see changed
take a look at your past and make a new one
and if you would, tell me what you have seen
and why you think
accept the consequence
now you see what i have wrought
you will be deceived by what i have wrought
make a decision between these two
make a plan for the future, hisee
what will you do, do you think you can come to terms
with your past
or will you let it slide?
you and only god would know
what you want to see, what you get
you will be determined
you'll see what you get
you'll see what you get
but i know that i'll stand by my side
as we exhale and exhale the hearts of the night
hold the captives, they are coming
release the ones who are about to be released
release the ones who are about to be released
release the ones who are about to be released
so release the ones from my sight
as i wait for the rays of the sun to break
as i wait for the dawn to come
i kiss the crystal clear ocean
and the ocean is prepared, i'll be ready to go
when the time is up, i'll be prepared to go
and the waiting is over, leave now alone
when the tide starts to rise
i'll be gone, gone is the truth
along with my immortal soul
i took a trip to see the sights
and the people, and the places
i was blown away
by the beauty of the Andes
the beauty and the pain
the mariners departing en route to the port of callisraphe
after a tough sea voyage
and after coming to the conclusion
that there is no place to go
i explore the terra firma
tears of the earth are floating
as the ship sails away
with the tide
still her face as red as the sun
she never left behind her aches
can she play with sadness?
when the captain leaves
and i know that we'll fly away
and she shakes her head no more
the mariner tells me that i have to return to order
i head down to the port of callisraphe
and i find that the ship is empty
and i know that i've no regrets
and i kiss the crystal clear ocean
and the mariner tells me that i have to return to order
i head down to the port of callisraphe
and i find that the ship is empty
and i know that i've no regrets
and i kiss the crystal clear ocean
and the mariner tells me that i have to return to order
i head down to the port of callisraphe
and i find that the ship is empty
and i know that i've no regrets
and i kiss the crystal clear ocean
and the mariner tells me that i have to return to order

you're on your way
you took the risk
you're prepared to go wrong
you've got your heart in your hands
you're prepared to take the risk
you've got your heart in your hands
yes sir, i'm a captain
yes, i'm a captain
night and day i'd scan the horizon
watching the dark ships rise and fall
rustling against the black sky
hear the mock alarm clock
rolling shadows on the deck
seeing the sunken remains
of sunken fathers nestled deep
deepest sorrows in their wake
all around them the ghosts of the sunken worlds
seem to float endlessly
in the silent night
someone's crying for mercy
you'll be waiting awhile
i'd like to give you a try
but you can't give it
now someone's saving me for them
Saving me for them's getting me crucified
but you can't be sure
something's dying a terrible death
crucified souls that are waiting for their daylight
crucified souls that are waiting for their daylight
sink into the vision of my nightmares
the final frontier is a long road to go
when you've looking all the way to the sun
your eyes and ears will be blinded
you made a scene here to make a profit
you're a tough cookie, you know it
you get the taste of the sun
your teeth and your lips
the smell of the sun
your first taste of the morning
your mind is hazy
feel the sweat on your brow
you wonder if you're gonna be alright
it's getting to your bones
it's not so strange
the loneliness of the long distance run
burning in your mind, you're having a nervous breakdown
you've got to get away from the arms of a woman
you've got to get away from there
see a woman, you're not gonna let her get close
you've got to get away from there
a long way from here
a long way from there
i'm waiting in my cold cell
the signs are there to see
the sign of the cross
the name of the rose
a fire in the sky

you pray for them, you pray for the earth from a dead man
the signs are there to see

as the body count nears one hundred thousand -- the angel of the east
the cross rises from the earth's surface
and multiplies into a thousand wings
one hundred and sixty-two
the angel of the east
raise your heads one last time
as the wings start to scratch the ground
another raises his head one last time

too late
he's looked so long for so long
i've looked so long in the face
so far away
but i'm still here
i'm a soldier
never seen a thing
never fought in so-called security
never fired a shot into the air
never landed on a suicide bed

have no regrets
don't waste their time of it

it's worth saving
don't be alarmed now

go find someone to take your life

night is creeping in, the light is getting weaker
you think you're safe, but there's something burning inside of you

you turn to the clouds and the sky becomes silver smoke
you think you're safe, but there's something burning inside of you

the heat of the night, the sweat of the sweat
on the ground covered in leaves
that the police officer has threatened to kill
begging for your forgiveness, a demand for freedom
a call to arms to defend yourselves
a demand for social justice
begging for their forgiveness, a demand for social justice
a man who cuts deals, pays the price
the police officer, the pimp

ask them why they're here
get them to come inside
get them to proof

you're never gonna tell me what's wrong

you're never gonna tell me what's wrong

you're never gonna win the argument with your acolytes
the educated fool, the apologist
the elitist, the devil's got a hand in it
the enema's coming later today
i'm tired of waiting
what ever is the point of the lecture
do you really want to spend the night or the day?
the elitist says... "shut up and get on with it
you're gonna regret the outcome
you're gonna feel like you've been cheated
you're gonna feel that you've been cheated
far and away, the one you trust

====================
by definition you need a vision to see
you need a reason to hope
and to waste no time in searching for those tears
trying to justify
the cost to myself of trying to help others
when it's all so clear
that the world is falling to them
will religion make me a better person begrudgingly of my own free?
and if so, can i help but feel unsettled?
i feel unsettled as i stand and stare at the barren sun
and the lips of the dead lips speak to me
i believe that there is some sort of a being
that killed my old man state a year ago
the lips of the dead lips speak to me
i believe that there is some sort of a being
that kills in on the kill that's right
the word i'll never be able to express
i'm floating on my own
so how could i be wrong?
and as i'm floating on my own my spirit begins to cry
i'm afraid my flesh will die
so i give my last rites to you
here is the power of the dark
circle of fire i will burn in the night
god, give me the power to make rain
river of fire i will burn in the day
god, give me the power to make fire
river of fire i will burn in the day
god, give me the power to make rain
river of fire i will burn in the night
god, give me the power to make fire
god, give me the power to make fire
to you, i'll give all my life
to the vanquished vanquished
the innocents died for the pope on his throne
crown in a star, in the sky above
the fires burn in the breeze
as i stand on the throne
i can feel the eternal flame
burning in my veins
who will be left alive to stand up
against evil and fire
who will save me from myself?
you have said your goodbyes to no one
i've found the man i want
i've taken his soul away
and i've turned him into something else
i'm bringing him peace of mind
on their journey down
along the lines of love and forgiveness
i've used my powers to my advantage
over the years
i've learned to love less of the world
anger, anger and fear
i've found that when i'm feeling down
i just leave it at that
the world doesn't really like me
it all comes back to this
oh, another day, another disaster
this time around, no fires
but this lump of coal
is burning, not thinking
what is burning is my thoughts
this lump of coal
is burning, not thinking
this lump of coal
is burning, not thinking
oh, another day, another disaster...
this time around, the fires are burning
but there is no fire to burn
this lump of coal is burning, not thinking
what is burning is my thoughts
this lump of coal
is burning, not thinking there are flames in the ground
there's a sound that hoarser
but no-one's looking
as the ground begins to tremble
you know, there's flames in the ground
there's a sound that screams panic
over everything's lost
there's a rescuer trying to save his son
but everyone's gone rogue
they've gone too far
and the wrong guy's on the run
you know, there's flames in the ground
there's a sound that screams panic
over everything's lost
there's a rescuer trying to save his son
but everyone's gone rogue
they've gone too far
and the wrong guy's on the run
you know, there's flames in the ground
there's a sound that screams panic
over everything's lost
there's a rescuer trying to save his son
but everyone's gone rogue
they've gone too far
and the wrong guy's on the run
you know, there's flames in the ground
there's a sound that screams panic

there's a rescuer trying to save his son

there's a sound that screams panic

there's a rescuer trying to save his son

they've gone too far

you know the prophet stared down the beast
as it rose from the sea
and began to eat his flesh
he said: "burden of proof
for the unbelievers, the test is now"
a course of judgment they would follow
to the place where the vikings were hung
where the blood

seven demons haunt the young man
seven deadly sins
seven ways in which you'll die
seven innocents died
seven men tried
seven isle soldiers slain
seven france france india eighteen rider left me no choice
riding north from huddersfield to oblivion
i was strolling through the streets of huddersfield
and it was cold it was starting to rain
and i heard a sound that made my heart explode
and i rushed to the scene of the crime
but all i found was the anderer than me
i saw the second coming of the evil one
the evil one, his name was
essemière, i know this place well
essemière is a fine man and a fine man
she always was kind to me, she never cheated
she always backed up my story with true
stories, she told me lies
she had no children, she was never
she was a free woman
and now she's driven mad at the world
the evil one, he is king and she a hindrance
i trod the city of tears, won't you come into my room
whispers in the night, the harvester's at his wit's end
you drive mad my daughter, you'll damn your car
she was a free woman, she never had no children
she was a free woman
and now she's driven mad at the world
the evil one, he is king and she a hindrance
i trod the city of tears, won't you come into my room
whispers in the night, the harvester's at his wit's end
you drive mad my daughter, you'll damn your car
she was a free woman, she never had no children
she was a free woman
and now she's driven mad at the world
the evil one, he is king and she a hindrance
irate as we are, i know that we can overcome these demons
excitement as we step into the light
i see the glory of the night
the angels come rushing out of the twilight sky
hold this soul dear, you will be blessed
well be happy roaming, peace be forever
iredleaving is a long and torturous road
tired of the stares and the tics
it's better to be than to be
you and only one person
it's a long road, you and only one
it's a long way from here
see the light of the valley of life
it's bright and flowered, but still shining
leaving you to count the cost, but i'll take it
then you and me, gonna and going
i'm on the edge of my seat
i'm on the edge of my seat
you're on the edge of your seat
you and only one other

it's a long and torturous road, galloping at the sun
around the world the enemy is preparing
for a daylight attack
the world's two powers, the dead and alive
one man, a machine
defeat, the other victory
lay on the ground, bloodied but still alive
for a week they've been hiding in plain sight
four quarters is no hospital, and yet there it is
ailing Britain, peril looms
the gates will be crushed and the world doomed
we Britons, dead or alive, we'll be glad to die
brought the dead to life, stuck to a stick
the lorry driver lies dying, his eyes bloodied but still alive
a week goes by and no-one comes forward
never thought that such a small thing might occur
but the smile on his face remains the same
four hearts,

as the sun rises over the valley
the souls of the dead
there's a time to live and a time to die
when it's time to meet the maker
there's a time to live, but a time to die
when it's time to meet the maker
there's a time to live, but a time to die
when it's time to meet the maker
you'll meet your maker when it's your turn
you'll meet your maker when it's not your turn
and so they walked into the open field
and i felt the force of the shock waves
as they climbed into the air
feel the force of the ocean
take them down, put her in a sea of love
and let her go
gonna let them go
gonna let them go
gonna let them go
they went into the open sea
and felt the force of the ocean
take them down
so they climbed into the water
and i felt the waves
begging for love
something to satisfy their desires
i heard voices inside their heads
they found them lying
as they climbed into the water
and i felt the waves
begging for love
something to satisfy their desires
something to be held and held
as they climbed into the water
and i felt the waves
begging for love
something to satisfy their desires
something to be held and held
as they climbed into the water
and i felt the waves
begging for love
something to satisfy their desires
something to be held and held
as they climbed into the water

and they be led to the promised land
i was never meant to be
here i am again
i was meant to be

as the serpent is pointing at me
and the others are inside them
it's his day
he's coming all the way
you'd better get ready for it's getting to your knees
look for the spine clutching at your heads
the venom is driving at your bones
it's threatening to break
your mind is in danger
you lash out at those who would hurt you
you're bound to go
you lash out at those who would help you
you're bound to go
but in the end you reach the final stretch
you'd better get ready for the final stretch
you'd better get ready for the final stretch

you'd better get ready for the final stretch the crowd erupts in laughter as the final blow
the sirens sound, the sirens of the dead
the sirens of the living — the sirens of the living
the sirens of the damned lying dormant in the ground
like coffins, standing on end
to bring the creatures from hell
to give them a chance
to live again
we are strangers in this desolate world
we have dark secrets that we must hide
but we too must face the truth
tale signs of the vikings: long antennae, piercing eyes
savages, red men
who kill for passion, who kill for glory
who kill for pride, who kill for wealth
who kill for wealth, who kill for fame
blood brothers, blood brothers
who kill for money, who kill for fame

who kill for fame, who are you?
fear is the key to your fortune
the eye of the storm is closing in
the thief's in your head
you're in a coma
you wake in the night
you wake in the dream
you wake in the nightmare
you wake in the satan dream
you crucify the victims in the dungeon
the eyes of the vikings are upon you
the serpent is watching you
you and me,

playing with your eyes
seeing where you went
feeling the fear that comes with age
getting ready when the wild wind blows
he felt the blood begin to flow
watching the wild fires
burning on, inside his head
he had to tell you something
you'd better get ready when the time comes
he's walking a long, winding road
you see him only in the dead of the night
but he doesn't seem to see you, too scared to run
you turn and look for the trail of blood
you turn and look for the smile on his face
you turn and look for the one that says "see you in court"
he's strolling through the streets of rue d'univers lumièvre
he's getting ready to leave the avenue
he's getting ready to leave the avenue
but something's stopping him, he's looking for you
he's looking for your face in the sky
he's feeling scared, he's looking for you in the mist
it's getting clearer just why you should go
you're searching in the dark, you're looking for the answer to your questions
it's not long before they say they have found you, you decide to take the bullet and sue
you deserve what you get, you're just not used to it
you were never meant to be here, you'll tell me why
you're gonna show me why i said i'm a fan
you're gonna show me why i said i'm a fan
i'm gonna go in and see
i'm gonna go in and see what i've got
i'm gonna take what's been done to me

and make my fortune, i'll go in and see
i'm going in and see what i've got
and make my fortune, i'll go in and see 'round the world
there's no-one here that can save us
there's no-one here to save us
we've got to get away from the arms of death
is there someone out there that would save us?
and it's not too late to make a stand

when you're tired and tired
the sun shines in the trees
and the fruitless prayers of the old ways
you're led astray
your life is a chariot before it's won
and you're burned at the stake
and your soul's in the air
so bring me the fire

to end this pain as he travels on the beast of burden
moving up along the mountainside
as he gazes looking down the valley
no regrets but his pride
he regrets what he's done
and when he's feeling down
reliving the pleasure
lost in a time vortex
lost forever, never seeing again
as he travels on the beast of burden
moving up along the mountainside
as he gazes looking down the valley
no regrets but his pride
he regrets what he's done
the past, the future collide
a single ray of sunshine
the future's looking so bright

i see a vision that brings me to my knees
as my heart begins to race
i try to push myself away
as my mind begins to wander
i try to see but there's no sign
as my body tries to break away
i try to swim away
as my spirit begins to organize
my needs are satisfied
my prayers are answered
my hopes are met
the killing fields, the executioners go
where i go i'm never sure what i'm gonna do
i'm never sure what i'm gonna do
i'm never sure what i'm gonna do
 done with living
it's a dream, it's an endearing belief
it's a reality to live my life
things that i know will be soon
the time has come to end it was meant to be
but the memory still remains
all the things that i've learned
about the wise men and the event
wayward sons
the citizens of terse but deadly criminal
a glimpse of the good life
a tear drops from the veil
as my life begins to fail me
i pray to god that my spirit will not die
please help me
please god help me
he knows he knows best
he knows my fate
i am in a terrible, eternity
the judge, the executioner
the killer, the damned
the hell that i go to
i only go so far
so i may be wrong
but i am so afraid
that if i knew the path that i followed
i would have gone
i only go so far
so i may be wrong
but i am so afraid
that if i knew the path that i followed
i would have gone
i only go so far
so i may be wrong
though i know i've done it before
i was hoping that things would be different
i was hoping that things would turn out the way they did
but they didn't, and they never gonna be this way

a city of desolation
awaken the fear of darkness to me
awaken the fear of darkness to the book of
darkness to the darkness, behold
the master of shadows, the dark lord
the master of the blind, the second
a journey to seek the book of souls
a destination away from the earth
a dark place, nothing is sealed
a city of desolation
awaken the fear of darkness to me
awaken the fear of darkness to the book of
darkness to the darkness, behold
the master of shadows, the dark lord
the master of the blind, the second
a journey to seek the book of souls
a destination away from the earth
a dark place, nothing is sealed
a city of desolation...
you say you are an immortal
i've been looking so long for you
you know where
====================
no, no, no we can have a ceasefire
the bombs are falling and the fires are burning
we must have a ceasefire

there must be a ceasefire
the fighting has gone on for a while
the killed and the wounded
here is the truce
here is the weapon
here is the kill
it's only a matter of time
it's only a matter of minutes
have we reached the point of no return?
do we really want this anymore?
do we want to live our lives on edge, lose sight of the greater good?
sometimes it's hard to make out what's real and what's fiction
the book of souls is burning inside
his eyes are red with the beast
he calls you his name
he knocks on my door
i'm waiting for the world to see
i'm scared to sleep because of the visions
and the nightmares going to happen
everybody's looking for me
i'm waiting for the light
i'm scared to sleep because of the visions
and the nightmares going to happen
everybody's looking for me
i'm waiting for the light
i'm scared to sleep because of the visions
and the nightmares going to happen
everybody's looking for me
i'm waiting for the light
i'm scared to sleep because of the visions
and the nightmares going to happen
everybody's looking for me
i'm waiting for the light
i'm scared to sleep because of the visions
and the nightmares going to happen
everybody's looking for me
i'm waiting for the light
i'm scared to sleep because of the visions
and the nightmares going to happen
everybody's looking for me
i'm waiting for the light
i'm scared to sleep because of the visions
and the nightmares going to happen
everybody's looking for me
i'm waiting for the light
i'm scared to sleep because of the visions
and the nightmares going to happen
everybody's looking for me
i'm waiting for the light
i'm scared to sleep because of the visions
and the nightmares going to happen
everybody's looking for me
i'm waiting for the light
i'm scared to sleep because of the visions
and the nightmares going to occur
everybody's looking for me
i'm waiting for the light
i'm scared to sleep because of the visions
and the nightmares going to occur
everybody's looking for me
i'm waiting for the light you're searching for something
you found it, found me
got me thinking about making a new creation
and after that the good and the bad
i'm on my way
spirits are flowing well
mysteries of time
now your expedition is completed
you still have a long way to go
start up the machine you did today
the number of the beast is the number of the man
or is it the number of the minute they scratch the surface?
there's a thin line between horror and wonder
there's a grey place between black and white
there's a grey place between black and white
there's a grey place between heaven and hell
maybe angels will help you to see
maybe your sins will be revealed
maybe your sins will be brought to light
maybe your sins will be ironical
asking the question 'what is it that makes people do what they do?'
being led astray
but the search is ever on the horizon
i've been waiting in the hoople
where i'm going
i'm going now
i'm not sure what i want
i'm not sure if i'm a man yet
but i know that when i see the light of day
i want to belong
to a social contract be true
i want to live my life on my own
i want to lift the unturned stone
i want to walk right into the fire
i want to live out all my desires
i want to go and see the fire burn
but i just can't bring myself to go
is it a hindrance to do what i want to do?
sometimes it's just a spiteful look
trying to strike a chord
but it never ends the way it's running
feeling trapped and it's a long road to climb
it's rough around the neck
and it's rough around the neck
when you're searching
you're searching, you're searching
there's a time to be
then it comes
tears for the world but we can’t get away from it
there's a time to live and a time to die
there's a time to live and a time to die
there's a time to live and a time to die
there's a time and live and a time and die
there's a time and live and a time and die
they're searching, they're
====================
i'm not a clown, i'm a man
and i've never killed a woman before
but i know that feeling when you look at me
you wonder if i'm really a man
or a woman, really i'm the name of the game
when you're lying in your sleep
one thing you cannot escape
you believe me when i tell you the truth
you scratch the surface of what i'm made of
but there's more to it than that
you question my existence
and if i was real at all
you wonder if i've ever felt
thank you so much for believing me
now i can't be compromising in my thoughts
you tell me you're not ashamed
you tell me i'm a man
and when i say i'm a man
you know i'm not a bad guy
you tell me you're not a little girl
but i'm a wolf
who cares
she'll be taking her time
listen to me cry wolf
make no sound
let her lead the way
let her take the blame
if i try to help her you'd better scratch my back
rip the skin from my eyes
rip the sweat from my brow
rip the blood from my head
burn my mind, i shred it
burn my body, i'm the devil's spawn
you're a coward, you're a man of few tears
you take pride in what you do
your morals are pathetic
the one and only true god
in the end, he's our decapitated head
save us all from ourselves
the wolf is in the head of the gang
the angel of death is walking right beside you
can you hear him speak?
he's walking right beside you
he's talking to you with his eyes
he sees you and you become one
he sees you and you become one

there's so much going on
there's no stopping the barbarian
curse of the sun

the blood of the sun
the name of the river
between us is death
somewhere there's someone starving
another one crying
you must not touch it
you and me, we're two
two people

it's a lonely space flight simulator
there's no other way
for a human being to know
about the mission
you must hear it
without going insane
running straight at the joystick
running straight at the stick

====================
the days are passing slowly but surely they will be gone
the fires are burning bright as ever
the eyes of prophecy are calling me
mysteries of time
flight of my soul
flicker against the black
night is passing slowly but surely
mysteries of heaven
flicker against the black
the book of souls opened my eyes
i have read and written and horror and fantasy and adventure and adventure set against the sun
but i don't hold
any key to their safekeeping
a glimpse of the future, a ruse or a forewarning
the signs are there to keep an eye on
but i don't feel ready to release her, hold her
the signs are there to keep an eye on
but she's never gonna let me go on
i've got to get away
go!
the siren call of the ages
spit between worlds
there are stranger and mores
somewhere between two worlds
i'm on the edge
you know i'm afraid
but i'm not really afraid at all
i'm just waiting for the moment
as the sirens sound, the seas turn red
signal back from the island
off the coast of montségur
when i can't find a sound
to take my life in my hands
i whip my head around
i check my temperature

they can summon up whatever they want

they've got to keep me going
'sauln washes away all the trace of his past
on his bed
his memories are all that remain
his face is pallid and pale
as he tries to organize his thoughts
his nightmares are flooding back
he knows the moment is near
his life becomes a chariot, and he'll go home
when the sun is rising
i'll orbit the earth and the moon

you're holding me tight
giving me a shove, too far?
pulling her at the last second

maybe soon, too late

after the war, they let her out for a while
after the war, she stays here
after the war, she stays here
but she's still taking the oath
she's getting her marching order

they thought she was safe, didn't they?

hey there, i'm looking forward to your return
i'm not sure if it's a feel bad feeling, or just some kind of happy coincidence
i think it's the latter
but i'm not prepared for the levels of emotion and shock
when you let someone go
you feel the same as me
but i don't know if it's the same or the opposite
do i really want to live my life again?
do i really want to take the pain away from the outcasts
do i really want to live my life again?
no, i don't think that's the case
although i've felt some of it
maybe it's just me
maybe it's just me
time returns again to punish all of us
we're digging the grave we've been treading
into which the wildest dreams
====================
i'm trying to make sense of it all
there's a time to live and a time to die
when it's time to meet the maker
there's a time to live, but isn't it strange
that as soon as you're born you're dying
there's a time to live and a time to die
when it's time to meet the maker
there's a time to live, but isn't it strange
that as soon as you're born you're dying
just by looking through your eyes
he could see the future penetrating right in through your mind
see the truth and see your lies
but for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise
there's a time to live and a time to die
when it's time to meet the maker
there's a time to live and a time to die
when it's time to meet the maker
there's a time to live, but isn't it strange
that as soon as you're born you're dying
there's a time to live and a time to die
when it's time to meet the maker
there's a time to live, but isn't it strange
that as soon as you're born you're dying...
...and be reborn again? giving a swish with your arse in the air
don't you know what they're saying?
charlotte, you're so refined
when you take all the love that they're giving
sticking with every man that you find
don't you know what they're after?
charlotte, you've got your legs in the air
don't you hear all the laughter?
charlotte the harlot, show me your legs
charlotte the harlot, take me to bed
charlotte the harlot, let me see blood
charlotte the harlot, let me see love
taking so many men to your room
don't you feel no remorse?
you charge them a "fiver", it's only for starters
and ten for the main course
and you've got no feelings, they died long ago
don't you care who you let in?
and don't you know you're breaking the law
with the service you're giving?
charlotte the harlot, show me your legs
charlotte the harlot, take me to bed
charlotte the harlot, let me see blood
charlotte the harlot, let me see love
oh, babe
oh, oh, oh, oh
there was a time when you left me standing there
picking up pieces of love off the floor
well, charlotte, you left me alone in there
to make your ends as a bloody whore
well, charlotte, you told me you'd love me true
picking up pieces of love, yesterday
well, charlotte, your drawers are off-color, too, oh
'cause you're making love all day
aww, 'cause you're making...
ooh
ooh yeah
aw, 'cause you're making...
giving a swish with your arse in the air

don't you hear all the laughter?
charlotte the harlot, show me your legs
charlotte the harlot, take me to bed
charlotte the harlot, let me see blood
charlotte the harlot, let me see love was many years ago that i left home and came this way
i was a young man, full of hopes and dreams
but now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained
sometimes things ain't what they seem
no brave new world, no brave new world
no brave new world, no brave new world
night and day i scan horizon, sea and sky
my spirit wanders endlessly
until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why
hear me calling, rescue me
set me free, set me free
lost in this place, and leave no trace
stranger in a strange land
land of ice and snow
trapped into this prison, yea
lost and far from home
one hundred years have gone and men again
they came that way
to find the answer to the mystery
they found his body lying where it fell on that day
preserved in time for all to see
no brave new world, no brave new world
lost in this place, and leave no trace
what became of the man that started
all are gone and their souls

and the birds are dying

you're standing in the cold gloom of night
knowing that i'll be standing there
ready to respond when you see me
say a prayer when i show you the proof
that you ain't going to stay silent

if i could survive it

====================
for the first time in nearly seven years, a blind man's meekly led the way
through the door
through the silent courtyard
at the foot of the meadow
begging for life, threatening to cut him off
but i won't let him take anymore
the warrior tombs, the tombs of desolation
desolation, the chosen one
are lying, desolation is done
and the bodies are hung with wine
in the sanctuary, the martyr's body is affixed
bring the killing ground to a close
clean the place, the guardsmen have been removed
and the remains of the one man, holy war
enter the raging roar of the battle
begging for life, threatening to cut him off
but i won't let him take anymore
the warrior tombs, the tombs of desolation
desolation, the chosen one
are lying, desolation is done
and the bodies are hung with wine
in the sanctuary, the martyr's body is affixed
bring the killing ground to a close
clean the place, the guardsman have been removed
you find them all like this
bring the killing ground to a close
clean the place, the guardsman have been removed
you find them all like this
bring the killing ground to a close
clean the place, the guardsman have been removed
you find them all like this
bring the killing ground to a close
clean the place, the guardsman have been removed
you find them all like this inside my head, numb with the emotion
this is what it feels like to be ruling
the ruling chancery, aight of sky
the mist is driving the charlotte mad
i can't believe she's such achingly beautiful

it's like she's living in a dream
it's like she's floating on the sunlight
like a dreamshe finds it hard to carry
the jealousy and the jealousy and the jealousy
with every step she goes, the road to ruin she goes
is an unhappy marriage, a nightmare she's walking
down the spiral staircase
down into the fiery underworld below
she's found the key to unlocking the door

he's stopped a nuclear attack but a year and a half to go
the bomb is gone but the memories still fresh
the men and women who are uniformed and standing
looked on with great pride
that they might well be captured
but for all their courage
and for all the sacrifices they make
it's only a dream, a nightmare they'll never go
out on their own again
stranger in a strange land
land of ice and snow
land of death and mystery
trapped into this prison, yea
recycled again, a lifetime of pain
trapped in this cage, yea
lost and void, one more soul
lost and void, one more soul
lost and void, foreign lands, wrecked and burned
dreams, visions, depravity
you are deceived, your mind preserved
death in death are signs of good and evil
nothing that you see can be believed

you're swept away by her beauty

i'm on my way a traveler on a cold winter's night
she stares at the sky
with an anger she shouldn't be
but now she's sure of it
she's wise enough to know
i took a trip to see the world through her eyes
the colours of the sunset
sunrise, sunset dance
here she is, sitting on a throne
dancing on a sandcastle, the two of them
she can't understand why the hell she's acting
this calm and measured girl
you must be a fine girl
you must be a soldier
you must be a person
she shouldn't be here, she's out of luck
she shouldn't be coming back
but she's here, ready to die
the battle has to be won
she must go first
defending herself
the other soldiers start to fall
the sand castle falls to the ground
the desert sand clouds rise
then the fighting begins
the sand castle finally falls to the ground
the sand castle can't last long
it can't take so little
the sand soldiers start to die
the desert sand clouds rise
then the fighting begins
the sand castle finally falls to the ground
the fighting begins

the sand castle finally falls to the ground
oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
it's getting to me so lonely
thinking of a time when we were making sandwiches
and listening to the kids cry
the voices inside me scream
fight for the soul of the thing
the boatman sighs and pulls the sail
out of the sun are sunk
and us sailors in our sleep
scream for help, you're on your own
the sound of the guns gets the sailor from his bed
and the scurvy journeyman's name is him
it's been three years and he can't be reaching
it's getting to me so lonely
sailing on and on and the waves are beating against the ground
sailors of the mariner's name are floating
judgement day has come
and the mariner has died
sailing on and on and the waves are beating against the ground
sailors of the mariner's name are chanting
fight for the soul of the thing
the boatman sighs and pulls the sail
out of the sun are sunk
and us sailors in our sleep
scream for help, you're on your own
the sound of the guns gets the sailor from his bed
and the scurvy journeyman's name is him
it's been three years and he can't be reaching
it's getting to me so lonely
sailing on and on and the waves are beating against the ground
sailors of the mariner's name are floating
judgement day has come
and the mariner's soul has been transferred
from the dead to the dead
sailing on and on and the waves are beating against the ground
sailors of the mariner's name are chanting
fight for the soul of the thing
the boatman sighs and pulls the sail
out of the sun are sunk
and us sailors in our sleep
scream for help, you're on your own
the sound of the guns gets the sailor from his bed

i'm the number 13, i'm the number 13, i'm the number 13
i'm here on my own i can't be compromising in my thoughts no more
i'm here to tell you my story to tell you a thing or two about hatred
i'm not a stranger to hatred as he was before me
i've dealt with it myself and it's just not the same
i feel i'm being watched a million times more than before
i've got to say that i'm glad that my life's not so bad
and that i've got a chance of living again
i'm not averse to seeking new heights
i've only got myself to blame but i'm soon going
going nowhere, and that's when i see the light of day
oh, the days are passing slowly but surely
oh, the days are passing slowly but surely
but the strain is still on my bones
somewhere, somewhere, someone's digging a grave
and as they work overtime to make a grave for themselves
they're worshipping a god they don't know them, not even close
who knows who they are, but they don't know he's there
somehow, they seem to have lost them
just by looking at them now
i feel a little strange, i'm getting closer to coming
maybe then i'll return
i'm not a person who likes to lose -

sweet little voice, making love all the time

to make the world a better place
i want to live my life
and i want to live my dreams
and i want to travel the world
make a great land
of freedom i know and i know a thing or two
can it be it's the other man that makes the difference?
there's a feeling that's inside me
telling me to get out of here
and back home again
when i'm lying in my sleep
and i know that the moment's here for me
i'm going to get you back
i'm going to get you back
i'm going to get you back
when i'm lying in my sleep
and i know that the moment's here for me
i'm going to get you back

i'm going to get you back
when i'm lying in my sleep, or am i?
when i'm lying in my sleep, or am i?
walking through the city
lookin', oh, so pretty
i've just got to find my way
see the ladies flashing
all their legs and lashes
i've just got to find my way
well, you see me crawlin'
through the bushes
with it open wide
what you seeing, girl?
can't you believe that feeling?
can't you believe it?
can't you believe your eyes?
it's the real thing, girl!
got me feeling myself and reeling around
got me talkin', but feel like walkin' around
got me feeling myself and reeling a—
got me talkin', but nothing's with me...
got me feeling myself and reeling around i can't see my feelings
open my eyes
i can't see my feelings
open a pair of eyes
i can't see my feelings
keep them behind
i just keep on reeling
running back down the line
oh, i can't stand that screaming
don't even try
music fans some feelings
it'll be tell me why
i can't stop that feeling
showing me why
man i love that feeling
yeah, blowin' me right through the sky

another screw on the loose

what's the matter these days
no one has the courage to put them away
nobody has any faith
cause there's a breakdown of justice and order
waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace
waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace
when i remember back the memories of yesterday
with all the friends and all the times
when people were carefree
and walking down the street
when everyone knew everyone
and all the houses doors were open
no had to care those days are gone
those days are gone
i long for the times when you could
wander down the street unharmed
when people didn't have much money
but didn't seem to care
it must be the cynic in me
but i don't really like things now
the violence, the attitudes
aggression that you see every day
a sick society looks the other way giving a swish with your arse in the air
don't you know what they're saying?

do you feel you've got a chance?
maybe you should try to take the bullet and help the man
others laugh and shouts at you for daring to shoot
do you feel lucky or do you worry?
you decide, you decide
you cast your vote for the weaker man
the weaker man you are
don't you know what you're doing, you cast your vote for the stronger man
don't you know what you're doing?
you choose between life and death
don't you care what people think?
you decide which path is the better?
you choose between saving face and saving life
saving life or death, it's the same
you choose between saving face and saving life
saving face or death, it's the same

the smell of burners, the sound of guns
you walk through the subway, i wait
you take my calling, you give me the finger
you tell me what you want to hear
i'll tell you what to do
you take my love, you take my heart
and make it our own
you take my soul, you take my spirit

watching the clouds roll and the waves clench
watching the waves and the waves
climb into the air
you breeze over the heads of the blind
seeing the faces of the dead

as you sail into the sunset
watching the clouds roll and the waves

watching the heads of the blind
seeing the faces of the dead
listen to the prophets of old times
watching the clouds roll and the waves
clench as the gates of stone fall
lifting a finger to light the fire
watching the kings of stone rise
to rule the earth and the moon
in a kingdom they will die

charlotte the harlot

there was a time when you left me standing there
picking up pieces of love from the floor
well charlotte you left me alone in there
to make your ends as a bloody whore
well charlotte you told me you loved me true
picking up pieces of love yesterday

'cause you're making love all day
giving a swish with your arse in the air
don't you know what they're saying?
charlotte you're so refined
when you take all the love that they're giving
sticking with every man that you find
don't you know what they're after?
charlotte you've got your legs in the air
don't you hear all their laughter?

your golden child tells you that you're damned if you're ever gonna get it from family and friends
your beautiful stepmother tells you that you're too young to have a say
you're making educated guesses as to what's wrong and what's right
you're taking actions that you're ashamed to be, oh yeah
you're taking so much pride in
you believe a thing you see on the news
when you see it all the time
everybody's making decisions
their days are numbered
you're a shadow of your former self just waiting for your fate
you just know that there's something underneath the surface

you jump at the chance
take it, take it away
you take it, take it
you take it, take it
you take it, take it
you take it, take it and the curse is finally lifted
you're hooked at the wrist and it's hurting your back
you've got to try to break
you're trying to break free
you're tripping over each other, you're falling

by the time the sun had risen, it had come
sunrise has gone
down in the canyon
and the angel of death has come
see my vision

hooks in you, hooks in me
hooks in you, hooks in me
hooks in you, hooks in me
hooks in you, hooks in me
hooks in you, hooks in me

don't stand there and do not see the world as it is
don't hold your breath waiting for the perfect turn
fetching oil from the can
seems like forever
i'm always in the know
i'm never gonna stop till i'm dead
i'm waiting for the time
when the cannon is firing
i'm in the groove
you know i can't stop my screams
the sound of guns can't hide their faces
they stand in the sun
and the goddess of the sun
angel of death
angel of death
angel of death
angel of death
angel of death
angel of death
i'm on the run
i'm in the groove
you know i can't stop my screams
the sound of guns can't hide their faces
they're waiting for the sign
when the timing is right
i'm in the groove
you know i can't stop my screams
you tell me what is happening
but i'll wait till i'm dead
i'm in the groove
you know i can't stop my screams
the angel of death coming
the mouth of the nazi is sinking
into the ocean
the mouth of the nazi is sinking
in the calling of the nazi, i will go
i will return with more death chants
in the call to arms, i'll stand with my hands up
in the heat of the morning sun rise above
the fires are burning bright
the men prepared for battle
they're getting ready to start
the battle is nearing
the tar sands are a reality
the men are coming
to killone for vengeance
it's an open book
open now as the blade cuts and the skin begins to turn
a man from out of place
a coward from out of place
these are the words of a man i have met
they're familiar faces amongst the dead
they're looking for their way
through the eyes of a dead man
a man from out of place
a coward from out of place
these are the words of a dead man
a man from out of place
a coward from out of place
these are the words of a dead man
a man from out of place
a coward from out of place
these are the words of a dead man
as the tar sands oil begins to rung
his name is Amar'e
he is the chosen one
and he will die
as a son to die and be free
and bring home the tares of life
i will be a warrior in fire
i will be a warrior in fire
and bring home the tares of life
the blood of the dead rises
the bodies of the living who have died
i'm joining them at the lip
as the light goes on and the visions of an age ago
begin to leave, to come back
what is real now, is fading fast
there is no place to go
is where i'm going
i'm leaving here at last
time is up there's nothing there to do
time is up there's nothing there to do
time is up there's nothing there to do
i'm leaving here at last
time is up there's nothing there to do
time is up there's nothing there to do
i'm leaving here at last
time is up there's nothing there to do
time is up there's nothing there to do
time is up there's nothing there to do
i'm leaving here at last
is there anyone here who can save me?
if you are in a position to help me, would you?
maybe you could save me?
but if not, then at the last minute, took your life in your hands
could i be saved?
there's a time to go
there's a time to go
but at this point i'm not sure what to do
i'm taking a walk through the garden of life
it's a good walk, isn't it?
i'm walking through the
====================
the sign of the cross
the name of the rose
a fire in the sky
the sign of the cross
lost the love of heaven above
chose the lust of the earth below
eleven saintly shrouded men
came to wash my sins away seven deadly sins
seven ways to win
seven holy paths to hell
and your trip begins
seven downward slopes
seven bloodied hopes
seven are your burning fires
seven your desires...

i am he, the bornless one
the fallen angel watching you
babylon, the scarlet whore
i'll infiltrate your gratitude
don't you dare to save your son
kill him now and save the young ones
be the mother of a birth strangled babe
be the devil's own, lucifer's my name
moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
moonchild, open the seventh seal
i count the heads of those unborn
the accursed ones, i'll find them all
and if you die by your own hand
as a suicide you shall be damned
and if you try to save your soul
i will torment you, you shall not grow old
with every second and passing breath
you'll be so alone, your soul will bleed to death
moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
moonchild, open the seventh seal
moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
moonchild, take my hand tonight
the twins they are exhausted, seven is this night
gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
seven angels, seven demons battle for his soul
when gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die
one more dies, and one more lives
one baby cries, one mother grieves
for all the sins you will commit
you'll beg forgiveness and none i'll give
a web of fear shall be your coat
to clothe you in the night
a lucky escape for you, young man
but i see you damned in endless night
moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
moonchild, open the seventh seal
moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
moonchild, take my hand tonight are you a man of peace, or a man of holy war?
too many sides to you, don't know which anymore
so many full of life, but also filled with pain
don't know just how many will live to breathe again
a life that's made to breathe destruction or defense
a mind that's vain, corruption, bad or good intent
a wolf in sheep's clothing, or saintly or sinner
or some that would believe a holy war winner
they fire off many shots and many parting blows
their actions beyond the reasoning only god would know
and as he lies in heaven, or it could be in hell
i feel he's somewhere here, or looking from below
but i don't know, i don't know
please tell me now what life is
please tell me now what love is
well, tell me now what war is
again, tell me what life is
more pain and misery in the history of mankind
sometimes it seems more like the blind leading the blind
it brings upon us more of famine, death and war
you know, religion has a lot to answer for
please tell me now what life is
please tell me now what love is
well, tell me now what war is
again, tell me what life is
and as they search to find the bodies in the sand
they find it's ashes that are scattered across the land
and as the spirits seem to whistle on the wind
a shot is fired somewhere, another war begins
and all because of it, you'd think that we would learn
but still the body count, the city fires burn
somewhere, there's someone dying in a foreign land
meanwhile, the world is crying, "stupidity of man"
tell me why, tell me why
please tell me now what life is
please tell me now what love is
well, tell me now what war is
again, tell me what life is
please tell me now what life is
please tell me now what love is
well, tell me now what war is
again, tell me what life is
for the greater good of god
for the greater good of god
for the greater good of god
for the greater good of god
for the greater good of god
for the greater good of god
for the greater good of god
for the greater good of god

please tell me now what life is
please tell me now what love is
well, tell me now what war is
again, tell me what life is
please tell me now what life is
please tell me now what love is
well, tell me now what war is

her fate, her innocence

haggard bravado, foolishness are your enemies
the jokerard smile, you see it in their faces
the venom in their eyes, they will not heal
until they find the one, a nervous man
until his last breath
then they will laugh at him, he's too fat to stand
carry on his day, carry on his legacy
to the end, the assassin will bay
the bullet in his eye, in the right place
there's nothing so brave as waiting in a cold sweat
waiting in a cold sweat, waiting in a cold sweat
waiting in a cold sweat, waiting in a cold sweat
waiting in a cold sweat, waiting in a cold sweat
waiting in a cold sweat, waiting in a cold sweat
waiting in a cold sweat, waiting in a cold sweat
waiting in a cold sweat, waiting in a cold sweat
waiting in a cold sweat, waiting in a cold sweat
waiting in a cold sweat, waiting in a cold sweat
waiting in a cold sweat, waiting in a cold sweat
waiting in a cold sweat, waiting in a cold sweat
waiting in a cold sweat, waiting in a cold sweat
waiting in a cold sweat, waiting in a cold sweat
waiting in a cold sweat, waiting in a cold sweat
you are not a man to be feared
you are a brave warrior to bear the curse
you are born into a certain fate
you will stand alone in a world of fear
of persecution and damnation
your soul will burn in a fireball
see, see, see: eternity
eternal view, eternity
the number of the beast, one, two, three, four, five: seven, the number of the beast
eternal view, eternity

from the corner of his eye
the killer's breed, the damned
a lethal reptile, the consequence of my life
the remains of a human head
left to rot and dust, to die like a snake
in the sandstorm, the sirens call

it's nothing personal at all...
you don't need to be a genius to enjoy your journey
the journey is over, the light is gone
what did you bring to the table?
an educated guess as to the answer
did you gain anything from it?
nothing particular that you'd like to be aware of
nothing that I'd like to be aware of

you see i stand before you
aggression, hatred
through all my years of looking for things
to destroy me, nothing prepared for the sight of these
eyes of hatred, i can see what you want
but i won't let you get close
there's mouths to fry, you can't bite
she's giving in to your hunger
you just can't take no more
the number of the beast, the longer i wait
the signs of the hour, the brighter i see
i hear the sirens of the dead
i've no feelings, i'm not so sure
you only get one chance, your own
and that's taking too long
i'm giving in to your will
and you'll be waiting awhile
i'm giving up on life too soon
time is up, so is your life
don't waste my blood, don't waste my life
don't waste my time, don't waste my life

we'll be given the chance to live again

nothing that we hold dear
and i feel that we've got to give
and that we'll be able to take it
all of us
suffering and pain constantly
mountain of anger and pain
ignorance and loss
prowler of wisdom cuts through
scared to fall asleep and dream again
nothing that we cherish anymore
it's all in our minds
scared to get up and leave

must have felt at that very moment that something was seriously wrong
had the strength to lift a finger
but had to endure the pressure
it's hard to put your finger on what was really going on
it's not hard to see just how much further they've come
ivan ice for dead man, caravan for the hills

it was only anecdotally, not signed statements

i backed away, i didn't respond
and he did what i wanted, commanded me
i backed up, i couldn't respond
he'd have killed me if i tried, i couldn't respond

and that's when i started to panic, but also prepared, fought off the demons
and now, i'm on my own, i don't need a co-pilot
and the co-pilots tell me what they think
i'm on my own, i don't need a co-pilot

and the co-pilots told them what they wanted to hear
i got on my feet, i got on my feet
and ran, i crossed the finish line
when the finish line came
what a time it had been
wonderful timing, what was said
surely one for the ages
important mission accomplished
overhead looked over the line
but what did i see?
i was never meant to be
and now it's too late, the darkness casts a shadow

one hundred years have gone and men again

to find the answer to the mystery man
they searched in vain for the answer to a mystery
murder in the rue morgue
they found it was only a file and a screwdriver
but when they took to the floor and cried "let the children go"

looking dazed and dazed wonder if someone's found the killer
an old lady in a black trench coat
the faces in the corner are burning

gone is the marauding that they trod
the fighting men that fought for them
the marauders that died of thirst
gone are the men that speared the savannah
the radio station that recorded their every move
the sirens of the dead they cd on the kerosene torches
the sirens of the dead they cd on the gaslights
crocodile smiles, play on the fear
of the human heart, you'll never loose

their mother tongues gone
their father had to be taken away

they didn't know what was happening
a burst of light in the night
an ominous thought
they had to get away
it was only a matter of time
they'd take his place
they'd gone from there
to the dark, the damned
hear the screams of the damned
they'd bound the wrists of the ledges
they'd blinded the eyes
they'd bound the back of the horse

see what i mean
it's quite a while since i last saw you
see what i mean
there's a time to live and a time to die
i've been wanting to know your last rites
here is the document
the final frontier
a strange place to be
you're a stranger to me
you seem to have forgotten me
i've known my father i've lived this long
i know that you mourn my passing
but i don't feel ready to accept that you are my brother
and i don't know which will be the last time
tears for my soul as i wait for the moment to shine
as i wait for my chance to shine
i am here, in a world of death and hatred
i am a stranger to me
you're a stranger to me
you're a stranger to me
i'm waiting for my call
i'm a restless man
when the sound of my heartbeat reaches your ears
it's not the soldiers firing from a hill
it's the screeching of mortars
it's the voices from below
they say i'll die, i'll die, i'll die
as they move towards me
and i feel they just can't last
as i wait for the moment to shine
as i wait for the moment to shine
i am here, in a world of death and hatred
i am a stranger to me
you're a stranger to me
you're a stranger to me
i'm waiting for my call
i'm a restless man
when the sound of my heartbeat reaches your ears
it's not the soldiers firing from a hill
it's the the screeching of mortars
it's the the voices from below
they say i'll die, i'll die, i'll die
as they move towards me
and i feel they just can't last
as i wait for the moment to shine
as i wait for the moment to shine
i am here, in a world of death and hatred
i am a stranger to me
you're a stranger to me
you're a stranger to me
i'm waiting for my call

i am here, in a world of death and hatred
i am a stranger to me
you're a stranger to me
you're a stranger to me
i'm waiting for my call
i'm a restless man as he fires another round
into the rage he rams the first
what strikes me as the least strange thing is the way he deals
he slams his fist against the hilt
and i can only think of our past few
as they march towards us
into the night he rips their clothes
into the daylight he lays
in the night he's burning his flesh
the hut he is his tomb is mounds of bones
and the chair he is he's laid
with his eyes bloodied, he cannot speak
he is a savage, a ghastly name
he is a man who's wanted
for hell or for heaven or for hell
he is a savage, a ghastly name
he is a savage, a ghastly name
he is a man who's wanted
for hell or for heaven or for hell
he is a savage, a ghastly name
he is a man who's wanted
for hell or for heaven or for hell

he is a savage, a ghastly name
he is a savage, a ghastly name
he is a savage, a ghastly name
he is a savage, a ghastly name
he is a savage, a ghastly name
he is a savage, a ghastly name
he has the blood of a god but you don't
give him your soul
and he will give your soul
to hell or heaven or for hell
he has the blood of a god, but you don't
give him his soul
and he will give his soul
to hell or heaven or for hell
he has the blood of a god, but you don't
give him his soul
and he will give his soul

you know i've wondered
where the hell are you going?
when you look all around
do you find wonder and wonder
what life is
walk down and you feel the breeze on your head
and think, 'maybe i'll be a farmer
and make a mound of hay
and maybe the world's a better place'
say a prayer and when the light goes out
you'd better stand there's no turning back
when the world has an eye on you
can you taste defeat, when you're fighting for your life
and when you're bleeding to death?
you bet your life on the use of poison
your village is gone
your neck's hanging up
you've got to get away
is it a good life, is it?
you scratch your head, you scratch your eyes
you wonder if you'll be able to find the light of day
you wonder if you'll be able to live your life
you wonder if you'll be able to reach the things you want
you wonder if you'll ever be able to get away
you wonder if you'll ever be able to live your life
you scratch your head, you scratch your eyes
you wonder if you'll be able to find the light of day
you wonder if you'll be able to live your life
you scratch your head, you scratch your eyes
you wonder if you'll be able to reach the things you want
you scratch your head, you scratch your eyes
you wonder if you'll ever be able to get away
you scratch your head, you scratch your eyes
you wonder if you'll be able to live your life
you scratch your head, you scratch your eyes
you wonder if you'll be able to live your life
you scratch your head, you scratch your eyes
you wonder if you'll be able to live your life
you scratch your head, you scratch your eyes
you wonder if you'll be able to live your life
you scratch your head, you scratch your eyes
you wonder if you'll be able to live your life
you scratch your head, you scratch your eyes
you wonder if you'll be able to live your life
you scratch your head, you scratch your eyes
you wonder if you'll be able to live your life
you scratch your head, you scratch your eyes
you wonder if you'll be able to live your life
you scratch your head, you scratch your eyes
you wonder if you'll be able to live your life
you scratch your head, you scratch your eyes
you wonder if you'll be able to live your life
you scratch your head, you scratch your eyes
you wonder if you'll be able to live your life

you scratch your head, you scratch your eyes
you wonder if you'll be able to live your life
you scratch your head, you scratch your eyes
you wonder if you'll be able to live your own personal tragedy
the crime, the punishment
the glamour, the way it's painted
the mistresses, the drug lords
a thousand skeletons in a matter of days
the worker, the artisan
the banker, the lord above
collision in the night
fly in the face of the prophet, he'll tell you the truth
the weather forecast for the coming day
the pilot's error, the disaster

if you're lucky enough to survive
to survive
the virus has begun to slip
out of the rats they prey
on their bones
a taste of fear and of vengeance
the scurvy rest were killed off
by fire breathing and fire fighting
the scurvy rest were put to the sword
so let me tell you about his time
livin' lovin'
he's a genius
now it's happened
livin' lovin'
livin' lovin'

the gates of dawn are closing in
the executioners are standing firm
down in the courtyard
take a look at your past
there is no time to breathe
there is no time to sit
there is no time to waste
there is no time to live
repeat: end of the world
repeat: war
as i watch the darkened sky
dark around me
i can feel the dying of night
the dying of night
the dying of night
as we kill one another
i watch the kindred spirits
lose my place
mysteries of time
flight of the dead
curse of the grail
whispers of the dead
mother of mercy
mother of mercy
mother of mercy
mother of mercy
mother of mercy
out of the silent planet
out of the silent planet

please tell me now what life is
please tell me now what love is
well, tell me now what war is
please tell me now what war is
well, tell me now what life is
and here we are, taking the tombstone from you
now it's all over his mind
he's lost his sense of smell
he couldn't walk at the time
he couldn't read written words
he couldn't fire a shot until he'd had a taste of it
now he spends his time looking for leads
loses his patience in the futile battle of wills
a lost cause, a lost cause, war
he lost his self-esteem and laid waste his city
a lost cause, a lost cause, war
he lost his self-esteem and threw the city onto the flame
demons are inside his head
they're buzzing, he's feeling anxious
it's not the fear of the unknown that scares him, it's the adrenalin shot
the bullet hits the adrenal gland
it's like watching a game of penny and you

intellectuals settle down and die
everyone's just got to live
and think what they want
to do, do what they want
i'm just a stranger to the land of the free
i'm in a strange place, believe me
but i'm open to what you want
maybe the time will come
and your island will be well
lands of freedom
i'm not a doctor, i'm not a nurse
so don't tell me you don't know
the enemy is rising up again
the beaches of delphine are teeming
the beaches are reserved for the bravest
the enemy is growing stronger
lucifer is laying waste to the beaches of clary
she crossed the ocean with a sore hand
and she said, "please tell me now what life is
and then you can rest in peace
if you only knew the signs
of her, not a tear would hide away
the secrets that you kept
i kept, not a trace would hide away
away from the eyes of the dead
mother love, give me the tears that i shed
in the city of tears
when i was wandering
picking up pieces of love from the streets
when i was feeling tired
reliving my early years
picking up pieces of love from the past
watching politicians and the politicians
caught between my legs
is it the politicians, not me?
watching politicians and the politicians
caught between my legs
watching politicians and the politicians
caught between my legs
sweet voices calling out to him speak
talking politicians and the politicians
caught between my legs
maybe it's the politicians, not you
maybe it's the people, not you
who are hurting, not you
the most vulnerable among us
the ones who are destined to go
gone are the days when it was your turn
but for one thing
and for another
it was a pleasure
to be on your way

er, up to you
ewe! over there
ewe! talking to you
hipsters and droves
the general commanding
bow down, step aside
for the kill you fools
the nautilus rusts in the yard
but the rod still hangs tight
you'll kill for the glory
or the glory itself
grasps the secret of the guilty
the jellied fruit are ready for the fall
the fruit of the eye are streaking across the sky
grasps the truth is revealed
the jellied fruit are ready for the fall
the crucible of the vikings is waiting for them
the killing fields are being slammed
the whiplashed seas are beginning to flow

living in a chelsea flat
seems so lonely now
nothing to do but stare
dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
i've got to clear my name quickly
i've got to clear my mind
i've got to get away from here
i'm on my way
see the light of the sun set
a lonely road leads to nowhere
an empty tomb lies unmarked
and there's nothing to do
i'm on my way
see the light of the sun set

an empty tomb lies unmarked
and there's nothing to do
close your eyes, open your mouth
intellect is lifeless
you're looking at the future doomed to fail
you foresee the phases of the human mind
you watch the development of the heads of men
you watch the progress of the legs
you watch the end of the line
as the power begins to turn the tide
i'll give you all my love in a heartbeat
you watch the decay of the soul
as the tides of time return
to earth, to orbit the moon
oh, the man that killed us all
oh, the reptile love that man brought
rotten flesh and bones, the deathly fear that is still living
a curse, a retributive power
on its tower, the newton wrought
the key to its hell, the key to its rebirth

the cigarette butts on her face
the edges of skin turn to stone
she walks right into the way of the law
she'll never know you're there
she'll be damned to follow
she'll be damned to stay
she's never gonna stop the damn thing
she's gonna make her mark on the world
she's the redhead
you're the outlaw
you're the criminal
you're the person who should be locked up
you're the only one that's gonna die
you're outnumbered by the rest
by a long line waiting for the last breath
get ready to sing your song!
single, single file
trapped in a web, the last trace of innocence
trapped in a web, the final nail in the coffin
you're on your knees today
and pray the world will mend its ways
get ready to sing your song!

of a civilization that's lying
deepest cut of all my life

they saw a vision they had
to help them deal with the disaster
they took up arms against the wall
and fought with each other as they grew
they'd a long and winding road
you only get one chance
to save your soul and save your body
and you only get one life
when the battle was nearing
when the bridge collapsed
my horseman ran out of breath
he fell to his knees
he and his lord screamed for his life
they'd never be the same again
they'd seen the sign
they'd never be the same
a hurricane is threatening to inundate the area
the sirens of villages are playing
the fighting is still going on
the advancing army will find it's last breath
the people have begun to die
the sirens of villages are calling for his life
the fighting is still going on
the enemy lines are being drawn
the corpses are strewn the battlefield
the smell of death and the sound of guns
eaten the fruit from a tree
slain by battle, dying to breathe
none left here to give
now the hunger and the pain
playing out all the time in your head
playing tricks on you awake at night
dreaming of the dead
the battlefield is a battlefield
tragedy for you lies ahead
your chance will be none the worse
don't dare run
you are weak and pathetic, so easily led
treachery lurks in the shadows
don't care now what's real
it's all just one thing now

just some of this refined aggression
just going through the motions?
when you're juanita
do you really really want this much love, just just some of this passion
do you really feel that you know it's time?

as a young boy, i was cursed - i was cursed - i was cursed - i was cursed

there's a time to live and a time to die
they're standing on the edge of the cliff
looking up the hill as the sun goes down
waited in a cold dark night
knowing that i'll be alone
without a thought for my family
without a cry for an usher
without a cry for a laugh
i was waiting for some sort of an event
to take place
and without a shadow of a doubt
there was no time to live
knowing that i'll be caught
without a trace of a dream
there's nothing i can do about it
the future's in my hands
the past's in my dreams
the past's in my mind
i make a wish and it goes without saying
i'll never know the answer to the question
it's in my mind, it's in my mind
and i'll say a prayer when it's all over
if it's ever gonna be written
i'm gonna get away
far, far away now
i'm not very well-versed in the history of mankind
and i don't really know much about the history of mankind
other than to say that we're screwed
maybe all we know is that we like it
other than that we like it

i've got you on my mind
it's only just a moment for a while i was living in a dinghy
in a country home
the air tasted good and the bed sheets held together
i could feel the souls of the dead rise
my spirit was with me and i was praying
to free myself of this prison
i was a fugitive since the day i was born
i am a free man now
and i know that i have the right to know
knowing that i'm breathing
free myself of this prison
i am a free man now
i have the right to know
i
know that i am alive
i am a free man now
i have the power to see
make a judgement call
feel like i'm on the edge
but when i'm lying in my sleep
and the dream is over
i can't think why
i feel that my spirit's broken
i'm drifting back down
my life's too damn late
i'm drifting back down
i can't remember where i was
i've been drifting back down
you remember what i'm
you remember my name
you remember i'm in the water
youalian for 'til tomorrow
sunriner waves goodbye
well, then i give you my warning
you entertain your fears
the dream is lost
