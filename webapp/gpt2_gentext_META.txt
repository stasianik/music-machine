tying it all to this stick you've got
whipping up your strongest possible light
screaming with the crowd, no matter where they're from
kill! on the screen, in your fat baby's chair
acting like a maniac when you can't move a hand
holding dear to your throat tight, may it be
that something's wrong?
running from the world, oh, a dog, it must be me
i'm chasing a deadpan story
something's wrong, far too slow
you see a young boy, clutching a stick, he's lying
the alleyway's full of vagrants
one by one, the man is getting closer

defeated by the endless use of the word
deprived of all the luxuries of our time

agitation, misery, and the most distressing emotion
you are the trash, you are the world that trash talk

shapeshifted, nose is up, tongue down
mangle vision, hear floating thoughts

the only way, yes, but it's best.
addamsness, the earth shakes
saint tooth, claws into slate
squeeze it, walloping every word
deny, twisting every word
one arm is tied, the other is pulling

lord, you are unforgiven too
too smart to know what's going on
addicting, the viewing is limited
obsessive slow deterioration
numb us up, then teach us one more time
abide, underwrite
all the ills that you may not know exist
arity, drift on numbered days
dim the light of desperation
burn your bridges, destroy your morale
scorch the ground to the ground, then repeat
all in your head is vanity
dishonor
bitterness, bitterness, conspiracy
kill the first born diabolist

and every weekend i play hide and seek, find and reveal my charms
and no one greets me with the kind of silence that greets you
no one greets you with the kind of silence that greets you
on your feet, or on your knees
freedom is just one of my charms
and as i write to you i see that my life is just a stage to get the message to the world

undress, put on some fake body, and wear a fake face
you have come to take your fall
fallen city on a bad track
victims of viet nam
crown prince, the pope, and the freaky old ladies
in a bid to rescue your soul
you may not like it, but it's all just a dream
you´re behind me, oh
my sunken ship
oh, under black skies
the mare's controlling the brood
more than this, she's made me a slave
and she must earn it as long as she stays true
undress, put on some fake body, and wear a fake face
you have come to take your fall
but you think you're out of the way
time has frozen still
your toes are down on the road
no leash is like the other
but its nothing new
and its nothing new
and its nothing new
did i miss something?
do i have the strength to know?
and can i find it inside to deal with what i shouldn't know?
drape your back so you won't shine
oh, but you're beautiful too
and you're thoughtless too
maniacal
overly fast
look out, to infinity
fading
====================
i'm blind in the heady east
don't judge by the looks on your face
the sky is black from the cold i've gone
i've gone to heaven and hell
look out motherfuckers here i go
my truck's good, my house's clean, my son is fine
but here i go, money's never a problem
and i'm living my life just fine
but here i go, money's never a problem
and i'm living my life just fine
can't fight the need for independence
revenge on my people for whom the door is swingin'
freedom is dead
i'm in hell and out of earshot of madness
liberty is value added
i'm in hell and out of earshot of madness
for all that i've gone through
let my heart go
for the one i've left behind
for the little boy that never was
mommy, back in hell
stop the fire
stop the fire
so stop for a second
you forgot to put the fire down

told me when i was young
"son, your life's an open book
don't close it 'fore its done
the brightest flame burns quickest"
is what i heard her say
a son's heart's owned to mother
but i must find my way
let my heart go
let your son grow
mama, let my heart go
or, let this heart be still be still
"rebel," my new last name
wild blood in my veins
apron strings around my neck
the mark that still remains
left home at an early age
of what i heard was wrong
i never asked forgiveness
but what is said is done
let my heart go
let your son grow
mama, let my heart go
or, let this heart be still
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
so let this heart be still
mama, now i'm coming home
i'm not all you wished of me
but a mother's love for her son
unspoken, help me be
i took your love for granted
and all
====================
so, who is this fool?
he swears by superstition
and hates the soul for what it earns
and does all in his way
make you a saint
and you live a good life
a fine life, say farewell
ain't no longer stand truth
dear father, beloved son
intense life, fight fire with fire
fight fire with fire
so, wade in and out
blame the world and blame your time
swallow the world with straw
but, dear friend, is it you or malice?
the streaks in the sand and the splatter the light
so, what is this?
a fire to cleanse the world of vice
a sonorous prayer to the higher planes
and i will lead by my side
reaching out for something divine
charging high for something you held dear
and while you're at it, what difference did you make?

so tell me why you've chosen me
don't want your grip, don't want your greed
i'll tear me open, make you gone
no more can you hurt anyone

so hold me, until it sleeps
i don't want it
so tear me open, but beware
the things inside without a care
and the dirt still stains me
so wash me, 'till i'm clean...
i'll tear me open, make you gone

born on the feast of a thousand deaths
and the one true heir
enter the hall
suicide, you fools say! what is that all about? what is this all about? death! you hear it dying nears, shouting death
keep choking, choking back now, choking, choking
i've become a suffocate
animated ghost cosmology
built to last
unending population
built to die
built to die
crawling from the wreckage one more time
ambush, asinine battering ram
bang! and there it went, with or without the aid of a crutch
this never: blacked out, bright sunsets fade away
a lifetime of blacked out
not a moment passes without a notification
an heir of babylon's throne
tears for remembrance, for the dead of night
all empires crumble, save one
timeless, untamed, uninhabited
state of war, state of disarray
cautiously, sitting in folding chair
standing on the shoulders of giants
just awoken, divine healing
back to the sun forever
hypnotizing power, hypnotizing
the summoned phantom
will soon begin to speak, just when you thought it couldn't be much
bound by the winds of time
out from this place, inside of demons
out from this place, inside of demons
disposable heroes
are we here to stay, or are we?
the summons chamber is being summoned
the servant races with grief and horror
he hears the voice of silence calling
stranger than you in your condition
eternal silence, the final judgment
destruction hammer draws deep
stranger than you, but no more
away in madness i feel my world turn to stone
i've been stricken by the grief of loss
i've known the loss of one's soul
so i've sought comfort in the knowledge that i hold
not from here

disconnect the people you hate
and help yourself to the glass
you're tired, you hunger, you fatigue
you limp your way
you crawl back to your knees
you Norris slam shut the door
surrender to the will to be
you'll get the message soon enough
when the storm has all been and done
when the battle has just begun
when the two of you

a future that is just and just

got to set another record
get the fuck over man only way to feel the noise
is when it is loud and clear
so what if it is only true death?
now i relax a bit a bit a bit
and i shake myself a bit harder

no one leaves my side
hello darkness, say goodbye
hello darkness, say goodbye
hello darkness, say goodbye
hello darkness, say goodbye
hello darkness, say goodbye

hello darkness, say goodbye in the heart of death

death, my creation
death, my creation
i'm waking up
completely naked
on this earth
i've been dreaming for years
and i've felt it since i was a child
and i've tried to kill it
and i've cried all i got
i'm dying of thirst, i'm dying of fright
and i've been hiding in caves for years
and i have tried to kill it
but it's only natural
and only when you have to
for a child, it's called fear
but a 7-year-old boy
can't hear his mother, cannot hear his father
he goes to fetch something
but it's only natural
and only when you have to
for a child, it's called fear
and i've tried

time

life's a walk in the park
you ought to know
why
you should too
don't want to stay long
do you flush it out?
don't you flush it out?
you ought to know
why
it's taken you this long
i think it's all been said
but what if it’s all said and done?
no compromise
we build a wall, behind it will be time to throw up
breadcrowing, please
apathy for the poor, your silence is a trap
and a grave for what you see
leave a poor untimely death
desecrate, you are sitting in your living room
with nothing more to do
weeks go by and then the light changes
and the room becomes more and more clean
dim the light of this room so the night will go away
will you help me
now you can?
light the fire
come on, touch wood
burning with fire
this room will stay that way
when the world goes away
through your eyes and your ears
you should be fine
the horsemen are drawing nearer
on the leather steeds they ride
they've come to take your life
on through the dead of night
with the four horsemen ride
or die young and wear age
that's a long ways off
your death greets you
the four horsemen are drawing nearer
on the leather steeds they ride
they've come to take your life
on through the dead of night
with the four horsemen ride
or die young and wear age
that's a long way off
you die greets you
that's a long way off
you die greets you
you're turned into dust by the sight
all the deaths are the same
famine, seduction, karma
reign
chop each leaf and spit it out
over and above all
try to please

if you can understand the me, then i can understand the you
lay beside me, under wicked sky
through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
the door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through
no, there's no sun shining through
no, there's no sun shining...

open up your heart
this is the fist that grinds you down
you know it's hot in your open mouth
you know it's good news, the other day you had a fever
and you had to be in a heat from a hundred
and you had to die, you know you couldn't
you went over there killing people for fun
and you have to survive the rest
dead body drops all around you
like a bad seed
and you've got what doctors call a "fame"
brings nothing but misery
you went to heaven this way
you know you'll never need many hands
your body's made to withstand many temptations
and you've got what doctors call a "sine qua non"
"lain by the unspoken fatherland of yours"
you knew it was coming, right?
and you brought this man to the center of the ring
because you don't care, you know he's cared much about you
and he doesn't want to burn in hell
your money tips the scales at least twice
same thing goes for your sins, yeah
do you give a shit what people think you're doing?
well, who cares, you don't matter much to them
your time has come just for a piss, a nag, and a moan
and you gave, you gave, gave, give, give
all the same old shit
soon you'll be matched by a general without a thought
and you'll laugh and shout at the soldiers
yeah, who cares, you don't matter much to them
your time has come just for a piss, a nag, and a moan
and you handed it to me, ay-yeah
i just fired up my game
and the sun goes down, the air's cool, i think i'll be back soon
the moment i feel right
the moment i quit smoking

treason, destruction of the apple tree
treason, killing, i've killed, eying you
my house is dirty, my room is filthy
one baby's gone, gone to sleep
the other is in his room, asleep, but Jane
watched into his dreams
found his heart, found his voice
found his pain, found his pain
found his heart
found his heart
chained and strung out, steel is coming
bang your head against the rock
hard
it's coming on, fits you fine
all the right songs, all the right weights
crushes on notes to stoke the fire
one by one, the kilts blast fills the lungs
no need for a care
built my fire

no more runs
no more mansions
no more streets

old habits reappear
fighting in the war room
reckoning a stage name
it ain't no good when there's nothing
ain't no good when you can't sing
ain't no good when you can’t fly
ain't no good when you can’t breathe
dare to fly your light
fight fire with fire
like a lunatic returning to theaters
instead of tearing into walls and slaughtering the common man
fighting to the end
the journey is ever-evolving
no need for a care
built my fire
can't find anywhere else
no more runs
no more mansions
no more streets
no more days
old habits reappear
fighting in the war room
reckoning a stage name

that cloud is making your home
black is communication, damn it
to say the least
because i'm black, i'm charcoal
black is the energy that shapes me
and i'm black, yes, charcoal
my eyes are closed, but they close as i watch these deceiver images
destruction through the eyes of man
black is communication, damn it
to say the least
because i'm black, i'm charcoal
my eyes are closed, but they close
as i watch the destruction unfold
pentagon

that all deceiver images of terror
but can't hurt a thing
to break away from the control
black is communication, damn it

seething damnation
index of hate
see how the hell they've broken me
into nothingness
now i'm free, i'm much too big to see
but the too big to lie

i have lost my way

i have lost my way

i have lost my way
i hate it when i can't go
i cannot tear myself away
and i cannot bring myself to destroy
an impossible standard
is pushed aside as i struggle to live
scratching at the door
what is wrong? seems to me to be the problem
and i hide my feelings
i am trapped in a world that i don't understand
and i am wretched and alone
in a place of utter desolation
i can't move my body, cannot i?
can you help me
distract me by discouraging you
distract me by discouraging you
distress me, dear
so you say
"lost my way
lost my way
i have my battles
gone to war
i survived
i am a burden to me

he watches me die
he helps me defeat the odds
i am the shooter in a crowded room
he fires up his game
he is known as a marksman
he marks enemies with his long, drawn-out sword
the more strikes the closer he can
the higher he falls
he seeks life in the end
he is known as a surfer for blood

the needles are out, the voodoo doll is inside
crushing metal, ripping skin
tossing body, split apart
split apart
now the pieces never fit
now the pieces never fit
and the ringleader never wants you
he only cares about your body
and he wants your soul
and he'll get you through to heaven
using his hammer, send a clear message to you
oh, through the time of the sun
dead man is the resurrection

using your hammer, send a clear message to you
oh, through the time of the sun
dead man is the resurrection

your enemies are crawling, get in the way
deadly pulse, world over

do we feel secure?
does our time really count?

are we secure?
does our time really count?
do we care?
do we care?
do we care?
as we fight for truth and justice
we shall win!
to secure truth and justice we must
encounter truth and realize
truth is power
decadence, the slide beneath the sea
decide our fate
defend ourselves
from harm
liberation, the turning-point in our evolution
defend ourselves
definitely not under heaven
ainedement, the culmination
aeons of deceiving
we have all seen this pastebin before
you will receive it again
in remembrance, you will see
how the world has changed

tempting, prying eyes watch no more
life's for your own to see into
life's for your own to see see
eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
nose for a hole, a litterbox for me to chew on
on the edge of death, the apocalypse is near
but the fire's out of my sight
and i'm sleeping with my teeth in my sockets
revenge now i lay me down to rest
i'll fight until the end
to the bitter end
war is never done
retribution
i'll begin to hear the cry
resurrection warfare
live attack
rapid is the death of breath
sound is the infection
death is not the exit of soul
seduce me with tales of bitter omen
i will soon be returning to this dark place
i'll begin to hear the cry
resurrection warfare

the promise of the unknown
the awakening of soul
eternal war

or hide in your closet for the riches of your future
infamy

the king is gone, outlaw rule in sight
south east Asia slipping, isolationism in rage
old habits reappear
fighting to survive
in the heart of turpentine
destruction underway
i've become a shock trooper
the teeth of doubt beginning to ring
revenge dossier is a book
a plan, broken, but it works
on our fragile fragile earth
ever since the flood
nobody wants us, they just turn their back
the last man, he wiped us out
nobody again
the man with the steel teeth
feels so guilty, he scrapes through it
he lives, he dies alone
ite crystal clear, lifeless

we're trolling you a sinking ship
we're trolling you a sinking ship
insanely bored, we're scanning the sky
scanning the sea like a virus
our brothers in arms

Lonely woman, have you ever seen this face?
lover of tired ears
you'd never know it was here
planting seeds of animosity
i've watched helplessly
as the dogs of war
mixed with disgrace and bitterness
has he lost his mind?
do you see the blackened end?
do you feel the fading of the world?
do you wish to live forever?
worn to repeat until i feel no more
truth is a tapestry that stays hidden
from sight or out from fear
can you find it inside to deal with what you no longer see?
do you wish to heal what father's done?
needlework the way, never you betray
life of death becoming clearer
evolution's end
never, come unto me for clarity
masterfully woven
into your endless path
dying time is here
sees the phantom horse, turning its back
just waiting for your turn
tragic but not life-threatening
the life of death slowly draws nearer
drawing nearer still
are you ready?
has anyone seen you before?
or long, black coats waiting for you
bow out the door
blood's warm and soothing
your body is warm too
but the beat of the drum fills the room
swallow whole the sound
so the hell are you doing?
are you ready?
has anyone seen you before?
or long, black coats waiting for you
bow out the door
too fat to be alive
it's time to get a job!
you're just another clerk in this place
you're just another clerk in this place
you're just another clerk in this place

our thoughts are just another one
but we feel far too real
and there's something wrong with us
and there's something wrong with us
enough is enough

searching, seek and destroy
for anywhere, anywhere near the jackals
searching, seek and destroy
for anything, anywhere near the jackals
great dragon ehotrick
send it crashing on the face of death
find it hard to see, doesn't matter what you see
or, look straight ahead, and see the future in death
keep searching, keep seeing
just the way it is
searching, keep seeing
for anything, anywhere near the jackals
treacherous, treacherous, bloodied numerous
what the hell is this hell you're fighting?
treacherous, treacherous, bloodied numerous
it's the ring, it's the ring
it's the jackal, it's the jackal, it's the jackal, it's the jackal

all in vain, you have put your trust in me
and i'll set you free

would you rather i charged you price
or stronger, won't you let your plea stand
knowing your place, knowing your reason

never happy with the world i've made
49ers fans search their brains for more
they found it hard to find the man
they reached into their pocket and pulled out their weapons
the man they never knew they would
disarm, he pushes, pushes, pushes
he takes away what he left for them
they cannot see the man, they cannot see what he left for them
they cannot help but wonder
what is he doing here?
search for the man

he will take your fear, he will love and kill
search for the man

fear the world that he will sweep away

dead ends and amplifiers
he learns to speak the dead's language

life is not easy to live by

i'm awake, my brain is trying to make sense of this
sight i'm leaving, i'm seeing is the light
out in the world, in your eyes and in
speech I'll save you from yourself
pain, suffer, and misery
i'll save you from yourself
sight i'm returning, to cast away the light

i'm awake, my brain is trying to make sense of this
sight i'm returning, to cast away the light
oh, no, no, no, no
i'm not looking for someone to cry on, i'm looking for a happy ending
here's the deal, if i were you i'd give me fire
if it meant a million times
making it work
is the end, is the beginning
running through the suicide lane
killing for your cause
leaving a trail of destruction
or, i'm caught between openings
broken, beaten, and cheated
i run from the curse
blurring the lines
creates a state of emergency
lonely people are run down
taken for granted, you're left to your own devices
this path i've chosen
hear me, and if i startle you
feel me
heals you, or strips your smile
you need a name
and that's it
someone to take your pain
oh, poor twisted me
i can’t bear to see
what i’ve let me be
turned away, me, as i was
warned not to act on suspicions
i’m weak, i'm weak
i’m stillborn
almost as weak as you
you’ve all but disappeared
the same thing
has happened to me
and it’s terrible
i can't take it any other way
i can't take it any other way
no way but down
cuz you’re all but gone
i can't take

it's time to get your way!
we are a mercenary force
heavy with the reputation of the best
of the best
who choose to join this deadly danger
we have come to this place
where the wild beasts feast
and we are the guilty parties
the beasts feast on our sorrow
and we are the guilty parties
on our side we lie
the weaker we get
the more we are swamped
on our side we lie
with time we will all meet
who we are, what we did
we are the poor, ushers in
the rich we get
we are the beat poets
on our side we lie
with time have passed
but the memory remains
running as fast as it can
it comes alive, it comes alive
but there is a catch
you can't catch a break 'cause you're caught
running as fast as it can
it comes alive, it comes alive
but the memory remain
the poor man's name is Bertrand Russell
and he knew his life would turn
and he would die soon
when he reached the end of the line
then he said
"gallows calls, dear"
you know he is bad
bad enough
but now, when we all clap
he saw his name
bad enough
to know that you wholeheartedly endorse
running as fast as it can
it comes alive, it comes alive
but the memory remains
the poor man's name is Bertrand Russell
and he knew his life would turn
and he would die soon
when he reached the end of the line
