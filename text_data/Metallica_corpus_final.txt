his will they'll take away, yeah

need the end to set me free
things not what they used to be
missing one inside of me
deathly loss, this can't be real
cannot stand this hell i feel
emptiness is filling me
to the point of agony
growing darkness taking dawn
i was me, but now he's gone
no one but me can save myself, but it's too late
now i can't think... think why i should even try
yesterday seems as though it never existed
death greets me warm, now i will just say goodbye
goodbye... make his fight on the hill in the early day
constant chill deep inside
shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
on the fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
for a hill, men would kill, why? they do not know
stiffened wounds test their pride
men of five still alive through the raging glow
gone insane from the pain that they surely know
for whom the bell tolls
time marches on
for whom the bell tolls
take a look to the sky just before you die
it's the last time you will
blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky
shattered goal fill his soul with a ruthless cry
stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
hears the silence so loud
crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

you can listen to the engines moaning out its one old song
you can think about the woman, or the girl you knew the night before
but your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
when you are riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
you don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through
but here i am, on the road again
there i am, up on the stage
there i go, playing the star again
there i go, turn the page
so you walk into this restaurant, strung out from the road
and you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
you pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
and most times you can't hear them talk, other times you can
all the same old cliches: is it woman? is it man?
and you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand, make your stand
but here i am, on the road again
there i am, up on the stage
here i go, playing the star again
there i go, turn the page
out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
every ounce of energy, you try to give away
and the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
with the echoes of the amplifiers, ringing in your head
you smoke the day's last cigarette, remembering what she said
what she said
but here i am, on the road again
there i am, up on the stage
here i go, playing the star again
there i go, turn the page
there i go, turn that page
there i go, yeah, there i go, yeah
there i go, yeah, here i go
there i go, there i go
and i'm gone guilty as charged, but damn, it ain't right
there's someone else controlling me
death in the air, strapped in the electric chair
this can't be happening to me
who made you god to say
"i'll take your life from you?"
flash before my eyes
now it's time to die
burning in my brain
i can feel the flame
wait for the sign to flick the switch of death
it's the beginning of the end
sweat, chilling cold, as i watch death unfold
consciousness, my only friend
my fingers grip with fear
what am i doing here?
flash before my eyes
now it's time to die
burning in my brain
i can feel the flame
someone help me
oh please, god, help me!
they're trying to take it all away
i don't want to die

someone help me
oh please, god, help me!
they're trying to take it all away
i don't want to die
time moving slow, the minutes seem like hours
the final curtain call i see
how true is this? just get it over with
if this is true, just let it be
wakened by a horrid scream
freed from this frightening dream
flash before my eyes
now it's time to die
burning in my brain
i can feel the flame born to push you 'round
better just stay down
you pull away, he hits the flesh, you hit the ground
mouth so full of lies
tend to black your eyes
just keep them closed, keep praying, just keep waiting
waiting for the one
the day that never comes
when you stand up and feel the warmth
but the son shine never comes, no
no, the son shine never comes
push you cross that line
just stay down this time
hide in yourself, crawl in yourself, you'll have your time
god, i'll make them pay
take it back one day
i'll end this day, i'll splatter color on this gray
waiting for the one
the day that never comes
when you stand up and feel the warmth
but the son shine never comes, no
love is a four letter word
and never spoken here
love is a four letter word
here in this prison

this, i swear! this, i swear!
this! i! swear! how could he know this new dawn's light
would change his life forever?
set sail to sea but pulled off course
by the light of golden treasure
was he the one causing pain
with his careless dreaming?
been afraid, always afraid
of the things he's feeling
he could just be gone
he would just sail on
he would just sail on
how can i be lost
if i've got nowhere to go?
searched for seas of gold
how come it's got so cold?
how can i be lost?
in remembrance i relive
how can i blame you
when it's me i can't forgive?
these days drift on inside a fog
it's thick and suffocating
this seeking life outside its hell
inside intoxicating
he's run aground, like his life
water's much too shallow
slipping fast, down with the ship
fading in the shadows
now a castaway
they've all gone away
they've gone away
how can i be lost
if i've got nowhere to go?
searched for seas of gold
how come it's got so cold?
how can i be lost?
in remembrance i relive
how can i blame you
when it's me i can't forgive?
forgive me
forgive me not
forgive me
forgive me not
forgive me
forgive me not
forgive me
forgive me, why can't i forgive me?

you clipped my wings before i learned to fly
unspoiled, unspoken
i've outgrown that fucking lullaby
same thing i've always heard from you
do as i say, not as i do
innocence, torn from me without your shelter
barred reality, i'm living blindly

i'm in hell without you
cannot cope without you two
shocked at the world that i see
innocent victim, please rescue me

hello darkness, say goodbye
hello darkness, say goodbye
hello darkness, say goodbye do you see what i see?
truth is an offense
you silence for your confidence
do you hear what i hear?
doors are slamming shut
limit your imagination
keep you where they must
do you feel what i feel?
bittering distress
who decides what you express?
do you take what i take?
endurance is the word
moving back instead of forward
seems to me absurd
doesn't matter what you see
or into it what you read
you can do it your own way
if it's done just how i say
independence limited
freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
freedom of speech is words that they will bend
freedom with their exception
do you fear what i fear?
living properly
truths to you are lies to me
do you choose what i choose?
more alternatives
energy derives from both
the plus and negative
do you need what i need?
boundaries overthrown
look inside, to each his own
do you trust what i trust?
me, myself and i
penetrate the smoke screen
i see through the selfish lie
doesn't matter what you see
or into it what you read
you can do it your own way
if it's done just how i say
independence limited
freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
freedom of speech is words that they will bend
freedom with their exception

do you know what i know?
your money and your wealth
you silence just to hear yourself
do you want what i want?
desire not a thing
i hunger after independence
lengthen freedom's ring
doesn't matter what you see
or into it what you read
you can do it your own way
if it's done just how i say
independence limited
freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
freedom of speech is words that they will bend
freedom no longer frees you
doesn't matter what you see
or into it what you read
you can do it your own way
if it's done just how i say mama she has taught me well
told me when i was young
"son, your life's an open book
don't close it 'fore it's done"
"the brightest flame burns quickest"
is what i heard her say
a son's heart's owned to mother
but i must find my way
let my heart go
let your son grow
mama, let my heart go
or, let this heart be still be still
"rebel," my new last name
wild blood in my veins
apron strings around my neck
the mark that still remains
left home at an early age
of what i heard was wrong
i never asked forgiveness
but what is said is done
let my heart go
let your son grow
mama, let my heart go
or, let this heart be still
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
so let this heart be still
mama, now i'm coming home
i'm not all you wished of me
but a mother's love for her son
unspoken, help me be
i took your love for granted
and all the things you said to me, yeah-yeah
i need your arms to welcome me
but a cold stone's all i see
let my heart go
let your son grow
mama, let my heart go
or, let this heart be still
let my heart go
mama, let my heart go
you never let my heart go
so, let this heart be still
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
never i ask of you
but never i gave
but you gave me your emptiness
i now take to my grave
so, let this heart be still do unto others as they've done to you
but what the hell is this world coming to?
blow the universe into nothingness
nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest
fight fire with fire
ending is near
fight fire with fire
bursting with fear
we all shall die
time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
armageddon's here, like said in the past
fight fire with fire
ending is near

fight! mama, they try and break me
the window burns to light the way back home
a light that warms, no matter where they've gone
they're off to find the hero of the day
but what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?
still the window burns
time so slowly turns
and someone there is sighing
keepers of the flames
do you feel your name?
did you hear your babies crying?
mama, they try and break me
still they try and break me
excuse me while i tend to how i feel
these things return to me that still seem real
now, deservingly, this easy chair
but the rocking stopped by wheels of despair
don't want your aid
but the fist i make
for years can't hold or feel
no, i'm not all me
so please excuse me while i tend to how i feel
but now the dreams and waking screams
that ever last the night
so build the wall, behind it crawl
and hide until it's light
so can you hear your babies crying now?
still the window burns
time so slowly turns
and someone there is sighing
keepers of the flames
did you feel your names?
did you hear your babies crying?
but now the dreams and waking screams
that ever last the night
so build a wall, behind it crawl
and hide until it's light
so can't you hear your babies crying now?

frayed ends of sanity
hear them calling
hear them calling me
birth of terror, death of much more
i'm the slave of fear, my captor
never warnings, spreading its wings
as i wait for the horror she brings
loss of interest, question, wonder
waves of fear, they pull me under
old habits reappear
fighting the fear of fear
growing conspiracy
everyone's after me
frayed ends of sanity
hear them calling
hear them calling me

into ruin, i am sinking
hostage of this nameless feeling
hell is set free, flooded i'll be
feel the undertow inside me
height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
life, death, want, waste, mass depression
old habits reappear
fighting the fear of fear
growing conspiracy
myself is after me
frayed ends of sanity

frayed ends of sanity

should be on your shoulders
misery

war is never done
rub the patch and battle on
make it go away
please, make it go away
confusion
all sanity is now beyond me
delusion
all sanity is but a memory
my life, the war that never ends
leave the battlefield
yet its horrors never heal
coming home from war
pieces don't fit anymore
make it go away
please, make it go away
confusion
all sanity is now beyond me
delusion
all sanity is but a memory
my life, the war that never ends
father, please come home
shell shocked all i've known
father, please come home
label him a deadwood soldier now
cast away and left to roam
rapid is the road to sacrifice
just takes longer to come home
come home
confusion
all sanity is now beyond me
delusion
crossfire ricochets inside me
trapped in a memory forever
my life, the war that never ends like a siren in my head that always threatens to repeat
like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
like a face that learned to speak, when all it knew was how to bite
like a misery that keeps me focused though i've gone astray
like an endless nightmare i must awaken from each day
like conviction, a premonition not worthy of, so i deny
i blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
i stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
i blind my eyes, i hide and feel it passing me by
i open just in time to say goodbye
almost like your life, almost like your endless fight
curse the day is long, realize you don't belong
disconnect somehow, never stop the bleeding now
almost like your fight, and there it went almost like your life
like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
like a raging river, drowning when i only need a drink
like a poison that i swallow, but i want the world to die
like a release from a prison that i didn't know i was in
like a fight to live the past i prayed to leave from way back then
like a general without a mission until the war would start again
start again
i blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
i stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
i blind my eyes, i hide and feel it passing me by
i open just in time to say goodbye
almost like your life, almost like your endless fight
curse the day is long, realize you don't belong
disconnect somehow, never stop the bleeding now
almost like your fight, and there it went almost like your life
like a touch from hell to feel how hot
that it can get if you get caught
like a strike from heaven that turns that key
that brings you straight down to your knees
like a touch from hell to feel how hot
that it can get if i get caught
like a strike from heaven to reprieve
that brings you straight down to your knees
almost like your life, almost like your endless fight
curse the day is long, realize you don't belong
disconnect somehow, never stop the bleeding now
almost like your fight, and there it went almost like your life

bullets are flying, people are dying
with madness surrounding, all hell's breaking loose
soldiers are hounding, bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
with war machines going, blood starts to flowing
no mercy given to anyone here
the furious fighting, swords are like lightning
it all becomes frightening, you know death is near
no remorse no more!
the crap rolls out of your mouth again
haven't changed, your brain is still gelatin
little whispers circle around your head
why don't you worry about your self instead?
who are you? where you been? where you from?
gossip burning on the tip of your tongue
you lie so much, you believe yourself
judge not lest ye be judged yourself
holier than thou
you are
holier than thou
you are
you know not
before you judge me, take a look at you
can't you find something better to do?
point the finger, slow to understand
arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand
it's not who you are, it's who you know
others' lives are the basis of your own
burn your bridges and build them back with wealth
judge not lest ye be judged yourself
holier than thou
you are
holier than thou
you are
you know not
yeah! who the hell are you?!?

holier than thou

victims falling under chains
you hear them crying dying pains
the fist of terrors breaking through

hear the cry of war louder than before
with his sword in hand to control the land
crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
fall on to your knees for the phantom lord

the leathered armies have prevailed
the phantom lord has never failed
smoke is lifting from the ground
the rising volume metal sound
hear the cry of war louder than before
with his sword in hand to control the land
crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
fall on to your knees for the phantom lord
fall to your knees
and bow to the phantom lord! thunder and lightning, the gods take revenge
senseless destruction

in the shine of the midnight revolver
all hide beneath a skin
a hope so paper thin
i'm at the door again
and the shine of the midnight revolver
even the promise of danger has gone dull
staring down the barrel of a 45
suck on the barrel
suck on the barrel
suck it until it's gone dry
for all reflections look the same
in the shine of the midnight revolver
redemption purify
will nothing satisfy
the scars just multiply
in the shine of the midnight revolver
twisting in apocalypse
death upon the fingertips
frigid metal touches lips
and the shine of the midnight revolver
because you lied
just a bullet away
just a bullet away from leaving you
just a bullet away
stop the voices in my head
caressing death again
becomes the heroin
forbidden medicine
puts a shine on the midnight revolver
eternal borderline
all the faces intertwine
oh god... now i see mine
in the shine of the midnight revolver
down in misery
down in misery

she's wretched, but she comforts me
and after everyone goes home
she's always there for me
and when the sun goes hell-bound
and the moon does resurrect the night
i will hide within her
not much good has come out the light
after everyone goes home
and i'm left here on my own
i will, run straight to hell and back
straight to hell and back
when they turn out all their lights
and i'm left to brood at night
always, return to hell and back
straight to hell and back
straight down, yeah
a lonely light in a window
just longing for some company
tragic, heartless, and hateful
but there's nothing as willing as she
and when the night has fallen
it falls hard and then it all begins
when she starts her calling
i feel my darkness growing from within
after everyone goes home
and i'm left here on my own
i will, run straight to hell and back
straight to hell and back
when they turn out all their lights
and i'm left to brood at night
always, return to hell and back
straight to hell and back
straight to hell and back
i will, run straight down to hell and back
i become two
we become one
unbridled, unequal
unholy, undone
the path is cut deep
the path is worn well
i follow my footsteps
to the warmth of hell
the warmth of hell

after everyone goes home
and i'm left here on my own
i will, run straight to hell and back
straight to hell and back
straight to hell and back
when they turn out all their lights
and i'm left to brood at night
always, return to hell and back
return to hell and back
straight to hell and back
straight to hell and back
i will, run straight to hell and back
straight down from where i stand i see
pain, suffering, and misery

killing and hatred, it is a terrible sight
reports come in of the heavy attack
message is seen, we are moving back
preparations are made for the journey back
it is a survival, supplies are packed
no more nights in this eternal hell
destination is simple, we move out
killing time - you left from the line
killing time - your turn to kill
killing time - what do you say
killing time
and he knew what he needed to keep us alive
no time for cowardice, kill and survive
like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
nasty word, he will take your life
the silence is over, they attack again
killing and hatred drive me insane
reports come in of a heavy attack
message is seen, we are moving back hey babe don't act so scared
all i want is some special care
on the run from some institution
all i want is some constellation
and i can tell by his face
i am a total disgrace
put me inside this place
move over for a damage case
hey baby wait a minute, stop
don't run away, don't call a cop

screaming with the crowd

overkill
on your feet you feel the beat
it goes straight to your spine
shake your head, you must be dead
if it don't make you fly
know your body's made to move
it goes straight to your spine
you got to move it
if it don't make you fly opposition - contradiction
premonition - compromise
agitation - violation
masturbation... on our face
darkest color: blistered earth... true death of life
never hunger - never prosper
i have fallen prey to failure...
struggle within triggered again
now the candle burns at both ends...
halls of justice painted green, money talking
power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
hammer of justice crushes you, overpower
the ultimate in vanity
exploiting their supremacy
i can't believe the things you say
i can't believe, i can't believe the price you pay
nothing can save you
justice is lost - justice is raped - justice is gone
pulling your strings... justice is done
seeking no truth - winning is all
find it so grim, so true, so real
apathy, their stepping stone, so unfeeling
hidden, deep animosity, so deceiving
thru your eyes, their light burns, hoping to find
inquisition sinking you with prying minds
the ultimate in vanity
exploiting their supremacy
i can't believe the things you say
i can't believe, i can't believe the price you pay
nothing can save you
justice is lost - justice is raped - justice is gone
pulling your strings... justice is done
seeking no truth - winning is all
find it so grim, so true, so real
blackened is the end - winter it will send
throwing all you see into obscurity
death of mother earth - never a rebirth
evolution's end - never will it mend... never
fire, to begin whipping dance of the dead
blackened is the end
to begin whipping dance of the dead
color our world blackened
fire is the outcome of hypocrisy
darkest potency
in the exit of humanity
color our world blackened! blackened! i see that nothing has changed

can he walk at all
or if he moves will he fall?
is he alive or dead?
has he thoughts within his head?
well just pass him there
why should we even care?
he was turned to steel
in the great magnetic field
where he traveled time
for the future of mankind
nobody wants him
he just stares at the world
planning his vengeance
that he will soon unfold
now the time is here
for iron man to spread fear
vengeance from the grave
kills the people he once saved
nobody wants him
they just turn their heads
nobody helps him
now he has his revenge
heavy boots of lead
fills his victims full of dread
running as fast as they can
iron man lives again! you think you see me in the glass
you think you hear me better listen fast
i think i see you gone to seed
think your reason is your guilt and greed
you are out there on your own
your face turned to stone
what ever happened to your life
stone dead forever
all right
you are a financial wizard
top tycoon
you are sweet long lizard
with a silver spoon
you know you have never had it
quite so good
and you didn't know
that you even could
your time has come to own
your touch turned to gold
what ever happened to your life?
stone dead forever
all right

but your time has turned to gold
your touch is turned to gold
what ever happened to your life?
stone dead forever
it's been a long time
it's been a long long wait
and you caught your fingers
in the pearly gates
you better leave your number
and we will call you
you know your problem
that's not exactly new
your time has come today
your face has turned to hey
what ever happened to your life?
stone dead forever
that's right finished with my woman, 'cause she couldn't help me
with my mind
people think i'm insane because i am frownin'
all the time
all day long, i think of things, but nothin' seems
to satisfy
think i'll lose my mind if i don't find something
to pacify
can you help me
occupy my brain?
oh, yeah!
i need someone to show me the things in life
that i can't find
i can't see the things that make true happiness
i must be blind

make a joke an' i will sigh an' you will laugh
an' i will cry
happiness, i cannot feel an' love, to me
is so unreal
an' so, as you hear these words tellin' you now
of my state
i tell you to enjoy life, i wish i could
but it's too late these mist covered mountains
are a home now for me
but my home is the lowlands
and always will be
some day you'll return to
your valleys and your farms
and you'll no longer burn
to be brothers in arms
through these fields of destruction
baptism of fire
i've witnessed your suffering
as the battles raged higher
and though they did hurt me so bad
through the fear and alarm
you did not desert me
my brothers in arms
there are many different worlds
so many different suns
but we all have just one world
but we live in different ones
now the sun's gone to hell
and the moon's riding high
let me bid you farewell
every man's got to die
but it's written in the starlight
and in the line on your palm
we're all fools to make war
on our brothers in arms
yea, we're all fools
we're all fools
we're all fools
oh, such fools
we're all fools
to make war
on our brothers x3
we're all fools luck luck, luck

how i'm killing you
come crawling faster faster
obey your master master

needlework the way, never you betray
life of death becoming clearer

welcome to where time stands still
no one leaves and no one will
moon is full, never seems to change
just labeled mentally deranged
dream the same thing every night
i see our freedom in my sight
no locked doors, no windows barred
no things to make my brain seem scarred
sleep my friend and you will see
that dream is my reality
they keep me locked up in this cage
can't they see it's why my brain says rage
sanitarium, leave me be
sanitarium, just leave me alone
build my fear of what's out there
and cannot breathe the open air
whisper things into my brain
assuring me that i'm insane
they think our heads are in their hands
but violent use brings violent plans
keep him tied, it makes him well
he's getting better, can't you tell?
no more can they keep us in
listen, damn it, we will win
they see it right, they see it well
but they think this saves us from our hell
sanitarium, leave me be
sanitarium, just leave me alone
sanitarium, just leave me the fuck alone
fear of living on
natives getting restless now
mutiny in the air
got some death to do
mirror stares back hard
kill, it's such a friendly word
seems the only way
for reaching out again
reach motherfucker reach
hell is worth all that, natural habitat
just a rhyme without a reason
never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
now your life is out of season
i will occupy
i will help you die
i will run through you
now i'll rule you, too
come crawling faster faster
obey your master master
your life burns faster faster
obey your master
master master
master of puppets i'm pulling your strings
twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
blinded by me, you can't see a thing
just call my name, `cause i'll hear you scream
master
master
just call my name, `cause i'll hear you scream
master
master born to push you around
you better just stay down
you pull away
he hits the flesh
you hit the ground
mouth so full of lies
tend to black your eyes
just keep them closed
keep praying
just keep waiting
waiting for the one
the day that never comes
when you stand up and feel the warmth
but the son shine never comes
no, the son shine never comes
push you cross that line
just stay down this time
hide in yourself
crawl in yourself
you’ll have your time
god i’ll make them pay
take it back one day
i’ll end this day
i’ll splatter color on this gray
waiting for the one
the day that never comes
when you stand up and feel the warmth
but the son shine never comes
love… is a four letter word
and never spoken here
love… is a four letter word
in this prison
love… is a four letter word
and never spoken here
love… is a four letter word
here in this prison
and i will wait no longer
i’ll put an end to this, i swear
this, i swear. the son will shine
this, i swear
this, i swear
this son will shine! make his fight on the hill in the early day
constant chill deep inside
shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
on they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
for a hill, men would kill, why? they do not know
stiffened wounds test their pride
men on fire, still alive through the raging glow
gone insane from the pain that they surely know
for whom the bell tolls
time marches on
for whom the bell tolls
take a look to the sky just before you die
it is the last time you will
blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
he hears the silence so loud
crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see
for whom the bell tolls
time marches on
for whom the bell tolls how could he know this new dawn’s light
would change his life forever?
set sail to sea, but pulled off course
by the light of golden treasure
was he the one causing pain
with his careless dreaming?
been afraid, always afraid
of the things he’s feeling
he could just be gone
he would just sail on
he’ll just sail on
how can i be lost, when i’ve got nowhere to go?
shovel streets of gold
how come it’s got so cold?
and how can i be lost, when my ship was made to drift?
and how can i blame you
when it’s me i can’t forgive?
these days drift on inside this fog
it's thick and suffocating
his sinking life, outside its hell
inside, intoxicating
ships run aground. like his life
the water's much too shallow
he goes down, down with his ship
sinking in the shadows
now a castaway
they’ve all gone away
all gone away
how can i be lost, when i’ve got nowhere to go?
shovel streets of gold
how come it’s got so cold?
and how can i be lost, when my ship was made to drift?
and how can i blame you
when it’s me i can’t forgive?
forgive me
forgive me not
why can’t i forgive me?
set sail to sea, but pulled off course
by the light of golden treasure
how could he know this new dawn’s light
would change his life forever?
how can i be lost, when i’ve got nowhere to go?
shovel streets of gold
how come it’s got so cold?
and how can i be lost, when my ship was made to drift?
and how can i blame you
when it’s me i can’t forgive? like a siren in my head and there is no emergency
like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
like a face that learned to speak, when all it knew was how to bite
like a hurt that keeps me focused though i've think gone astray
like a load of rain that i must awaken from each day
like a dream
a beautiful dream
not worthy of so i deny ...... yeah
you close your eyes and try to wish it all into place
you never opened them so it passed you by
you close your eyes so you may never fall from grace
you open just in time to say goodbye
almost like your life
almost like your endless fight
struggling along
balancing in right and wrong
why is it so hard
always pull the joker card
almost like your fight
and there it went
almost like your life
like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
like a spring that cannot be in current till it's time to drink
like a puzzle, with missing pieces, and the box is thrown away
like a release from prison that i didn't know i was in
like a fight to live the past i prayed to leave from way back then
like a general without a mission until the war will start again
you close your eyes and try to wish it all into place
you never opened them so it passed you by
you close your eyes so you may never fall from grace
you open just in time to say goodbye
almost like your life
almost like your endless fight
struggling along
balancing in right and wrong
why is it so hard
always pull the joker card
almost like your fight
and there it went
almost like your life. .... yeah.... ohh yeah
ohhhhhhhhhh yeaahh
like a touch from hell to feel how hot that it can get if you get caught
like a touch from heaven on this breeze that brings you straight down to your knees
like a touch from hell to feel how hot that it can get if you get caught
like a touch from heaven on this breeze that brings you straight down to your knees
ohhhh yeaahhh
almost like your life
almost like your endless fight
struggling along
balancing in right and wrong
why is it so hard
always pull the joker card
almost like your fight
and there it went
almost like your life
that was just your life metallica

your bodies waiting for his whips

the fists of terrors breaking through

hear the cry of war
louder than before
with this sword in hand
to control the land
crushing metal strikes
on this frightening night
fall onto your knees
for the phantom lord

sweet lovely death

i killed your baby today
it doesn't matter much to me, as long as it's dead
sweet lovely death
just waiting for your breath
come sweet death one last caress
one last caress i feel uptight on a saturday night
nine o' clock, the radio's the only light
i hear my song and it pulls me through
comes on strong, tells me what i got to do
i got to
get up
everybody's gonna move their feet
get down
everybody's gonna leave their seat
you gotta lose your mind in detroit rock city
get up
everybody's gonna move their feet
get down
everybody's gonna leave their seat
getting late
i just can't wait
ten o'clock and i know i gotta hit the road
first i drink, then i smoke
start up the car, and i try to make the midnight show
get up
everybody's gonna move their feet
get down
everybody's gonna leave their seat
movin' fast, doin' 95
hit top speed but i'm still movin' much too slow
i feel so good, i'm so alive
i hear my song playin' on the radio
it goes
get up
everybody's gonna move their feet
get down
everybody's gonna leave their seat
you gotta lose your mind in detroit rock city
twelve o'clock, i gotta rock
there's a truck ahead, lights starin' at my eyes
oh my god, no time to turn
i got to laugh 'cause i know i'm gonna die
why
get up
everybody's gonna move their feet
get down
everybody's gonna leave their seat claustrophobic
crawl out of this skin
hard explosive
reach in, pull that pin
ain't no one gonna watch the road
intention reckless
ain't no one gonna slow the row
invention reckless
so i cross that line
pushing myself, daring myself
scaring myself in the suicide lane
deadly pulse
pawing at the wheel
death magnetic
pulling closer still
ain't no one gonna hold the border
insanely reckless
ain't no one gonna give the order
inanely reckless
so i cross that line
pushing myself, daring myself
scaring myself in the suicide lane
i scare myself
crushing metal, ripping skin
tossing body mannequin
splatter blood, bleeding gas
mangle flesh, snapping spine
dripping bloody valentine
shatter face, spitting glass
what makes me drift a litter bit closer
dead man takes the steering wheel
what makes me know it's time to cross over
dead man takes the steering wheel
see through the skin the bones they all rattle
i start to see the end in me
flesh falls away the bones they all shatter
i start to see the end in me
clautrophobic
crawl out of this skin
hard explosive
reach in, pull that pin
every moment, flashed before my eyes
i wake up screaming
life is undenied
ain't no one gonna search the record
intensely reckless
ain't no one gonna get the message
inherely reckless
i cross that line
pushing myself, daring myself
scaring myself in the suicide lane
pushing myself in the suicide lane
daring myself in the suicide lane
pushing myself in the suicide lane
daring myself in the suicide lane we won’t need to intimidate you

of a thousand psychic wars

my armor is destroyed
i have used up all my weapons
and i’m helpless and bereaved
wounds are all i’m made of

time we had a break from it
time we had some leave
we've been living in the flames
we've been eating out our brains

another town i've left behind
another drink, completely blind
another hotel i can't find
another backstage pass for you
another tube of superglue
another border to get through
drivin' like a maniac
drivin' way to hell and back
another room, a case to pack
we are the road crew
another hotel, we can burn
another screw, another turn
another europe map to learn

jack's in his corset, says to jane, who's in her vest
me, babe, i'm in a rock n' roll band
friday night's a picture show
those were different times
and the poets studied rules of verse
and all the ladies rolled their eyes
sweet jane
sweet jane
sweet jane
now, jack, he is a banker
and jane, she is a clerk
and the both of them are saving up their money
then they come home from work
sittin' by the fire
radio just played a little classical music for you kids
the march of the wooden soldiers
and you can hear jack say
sweet jane
sweet jane
sweet jane
some people like to go out dancing
and other people, they gotta work
and there's always some evil mothers
they'll tell you life is full of dirtand the women never really faint
and the villans always blink their eyes
and the children are the only ones who blush
'cause life is just to die
but, anyone who has a heart
wouldn't want to turn around and break it
and anyone who ever played the part
he wouldn't want to turn around and fake it
sweet jane  sleep, and dream of this
death angel's kiss
brings final bliss
come believe me
empty they say
death, won't you let me stay
empty they say
death, hear me call your name
oh, call your name
suicide, i've already died
you're just the funeral i've been waiting for
cyanide, living dead inside
break this empty shell forevermore
wait, wait patiently
your death-black wings
unfolding sleep
spreading o'er me
empty they say

empty they say
death, hear me call your name
oh, call your name

suicide, i've already died
it's just the funeral i've been waiting for
cyanide, living dead inside
break this empty shell forevermore
say, is that rain or are they tears
that stained your concrete face for years?
the crying, weeping, shedding strife
year after year, life after life
an air of freshly broken ground
a concrete angel laid right down
upon the grave which swallows fast
it's peace at last
o peace at last
empty they say
death, won't you let me stay
empty they say
death, hear me call your name
oh, call your name
suicide, i've already died
you're just the funeral i've been waiting for
cyanide, living dead inside
break this empty shell forevermore

forevermore
forevermore
it's the funeral i've been waiting for judas priest cover
pounding the world like a battering ram
forging the furnace for the final grand slam
chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
hammering anvils straining muscle and might
shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
fast devastating and desolisating the curse
blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth wielding the axe comes the one culmination
that's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed
sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage
of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
now grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled
till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
the slipping and sliding corrosive subsiding that withered and wained till the world seemed all drained fills the bay
pounding the world like a battering ram
forging the furnace for the final grand slam
chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
second to none alright
