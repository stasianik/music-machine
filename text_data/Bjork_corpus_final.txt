his wicked sense of humour
suggests exciting sex
his fingers, they focus on her
touches, he's venus as a boy
he believes in a beauty
he's venus as a boy
he believes in a beauty
he believes in a beauty
he's venus as a boy
he believes in a beauty
he believes in a beauty
he's venus as a boy
he believes in a beauty
he's exploring the taste of her
arousal, so accurate
he sets off the beauty in her
he's venus, venus as a boy
he believes in a beauty
he's venus as a boy
he believes in a beauty
he believes in a beauty
he's venus as a boy

our love was my womb
but our bond has broken
my shield is gone
my protection is taken
i am one wound
my pulsating body
suffering being
my heart is enormous lake
black with potion
i am blind
drowning in this ocean
my soul torn apart
my spirit is broken
into the fabric of all
he is woven
you fear my limitless emotions
i am bored of your apocalyptic obsessions
did i love you too much?
devotion bent me broken
so i rebelled
destroyed the icon
i did it for love
i honoured my feelings
you betrayed your own heart
corrupted that organ
family was always
our sacred mutual mission
which you abandoned
you have nothing to give
your heart is hollow
i'm drowned in sorrows
no hope in sight of ever recover
eternal pain and horrors
i am a glowing shiny rocket
returning home
as i enter the atmosphere
i burn off layer by layer

pedalling through
the dark currents
i find an accurate copy
a blueprint of the pleasure in me
swirling black lilies totally ripe
a secret code carved
a secret code carved
swirling black lilies totally ripe
he offers a handshake
crooked five fingers
they form a pattern
yet to be matched
on the surface simplicity
swirling black lilies totally ripe
but the darkest pit in me
and it's pagan poetry
swirling black lilies totally ripe
pagan poetry
morse coding signals signals
they pulsate they wake me up
they wake me up
pulsate from my hibernating
on the surface simplicity
swirling black lilies totally ripe
but the darkest pit in me
and it's pagan poetry
swirling black lilies totally ripe
pagan poetry
swirling black lilies totally ripe
swirling black lilies totally ripe
i love him, i love him
i love him, i love him
i love him, i love him
i love him, i love him
i...
she loves him, she loves him
this time
she loves him, she loves him
i'm going to keep it to myself
she loves him, she loves him
this time
she loves him, she loves him
i'm going to keep me all to myself
she loves him, she loves him
and he makes me want to hand myself over
she loves him, she loves him
she loves him, she loves him
and he makes me want to hand myself over
she loves him, she loves him
she loves him, she loves him
she loves him, she loves him
she loves him, she loves him

a juxtapositioning fate
find our mutual coordinates
moments of clarity are so rare
i better document this
at last the view is fierce
all that matters is
who is open chested
and who has coagulated
who can share and
who has shut down the chances?
show me emotional respect, oh respect, oh respect
and i have emotional needs, oh needs, oh ooh
i wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, oh ooh
what is it that i have
that makes me feel your pain?
like milking a stone
to get you to say it
who is open?
and who has shut up
and if one feels closed
how does one stay open?
we have emotional needs, oh needs, oh needs, oh ooh
i wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, ooh
oh, show some emotional respect, oh respect, oh ooh
a juxtapositioning fate

we live on a mountain
right at the top
there's a beautiful view
from the top of the mountain
every morning i walk towards the edge
and throw little things off
like car parts, bottles and cutlery
or whatever i find lying around
it's become a habit
a way to start the day
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
it's early morning
no one is awake
i'm back at my cliff
still throwing things off
i listen to the sounds they make
on their way down
i follow with my eyes till they crash
i imagine what my body would sound like
slamming against those rocks
and when it lands
will my eyes be closed or open?
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you

all these accidents that happen

and you push me up to
this state of emergency
how beautiful to be

maybe he will come out of this
maybe he won't
somehow i'm not too bothered either way
maybe he will come out of this loving me
maybe he will come out of this
i smell declarations of solitude
maybe he will come out of this
vietnam vet comes after the war
lands in my house
this wild lion doesn't fit in this chair
maybe he will come out of this loving me
maybe he won't
i'm not taming no animal
maybe he will come out of this
once it was simple
one feeling at a time
it reached its peak then transformed
these abstract complex feelings
i just don't know how to handle them
should i throw oil on one of these moods
but which one?
the joy peak
humor peak
frustration peak
anything peak
for clarity
maybe he will come out of this loving me
maybe he won't
i'm not taming no animal
maybe he will come out of this
maybe he will come out of this
maybe he won't
somehow i'm not too bothered either way
somehow i'm not too bothered either way
i refuse, it's a sign of maturity
to be stuck in complexity
i demand all clarity
maybe he will come out of this
or he will feel solitaire
somehow i'm not too bothered
i'd just like to know

all of my mouth was kissing him
now, into the air, i am missing him
is this excess texting a blessing?
two music nerds obsessing
he reminds me of the love in me
i'm celebrating on a vibrancy
sending each other mp3s
falling in love to a song
this handsomest of wickermen
he asked if i could wait for him
now, how many lightyears this interim
while i fall in love with his songs?
his hands are good in protecting me
touching and caressing me
but would it be trespassing
wanting him to be blissing me
robbing him of his youth?
cliffhanger like suspension
my longing has formed its own skeleton
bridging the gap between singletons
sending each others these songs
the interior of these melodies
is perhaps where we are meant to be
our physical union a fantasy
i just fell in love with a song
so, i reserve my own intimacies
i bundle them up in packages
my rawward longing far too visceral
did i just fall in love with love?

i'm a fountain of blood
in the shape of a girl
you're the bird on the brim
hypnotised by the whirl
drink me, make me feel real
wet your beak in the stream
game we're playing is life
love's a two way dream
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a path of cinders
burning under your feet
you're the one who walks me
i'm your one way street
i'm a whisper in the water
secret for you to hear
you're the one who grows distant
when i beckon you near
leave me now, return tonight
tide will show you the way
if you forget my name
you will go astray
like a killer whale
trapped in a bay
i'm a tree that grows hearts
one for each that you take
you're the intruder's hand
i'm the branch that you break

my healed chest wound
transformed into a gate
where i receive love from
where i give love from
and i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
split into many parts
splattered light beams into prisms
that will reunite
if you care for me, care for me
if you care for me, care for me
care for me, care for me
and then i'll care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
care for you, care for you
didn't used to be so needy
just more broken than normal
proud self-sufficiency
my silhouette is oval
it is a gate
i can care for you, care for you from
i can care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
i care for you, care for you
you care for me, care for me
care for you

shh, shh
it's oh, so quiet, shh, shh
it's oh, so still, shh, shh
you're all alone, shh, shh
and so peaceful until
you fall in love, zing boom
the sky up above, zing boom
is caving in, wow bam!
you've never been so nuts about a guy
you wanna laugh, you wanna cry
you cross your heart and hope to die
till it's over, and then, shh, shh
it's nice and quiet, shh, shh
but soon again, shh, shh
starts another big riot
you blow a fuse, zing boom
the devil cuts loose, zing boom
so what's the use, wow bam!
of falling in love?
it's oh, so quiet
it's oh, so still
you're all alone
and so peaceful until
you ring the bell, bim bam
you shout and you yell, hi ho-ho
you broke the spell
gee, this is swell, you almost have a fit
this guy is "gorge" and i got hit
there's no mistake, this is it!
till it's over, and then
it's nice and quiet, shh, shh
but soon again, shh, shh
starts another big riot
you blow a fuse, zing boom
the devil cuts loose, zing boom
so what's the use, wow bam!
of falling in love?
the sky caves in
the devil cuts loose
you blow, blow, blow
blow, blow your fuse, ahh!
when you fall in love
shh

you'll be given love
you'll be taken care of
you'll be given love
you have to trust it
maybe not from the sources
you have poured yours
maybe not from the directions
you are staring at
twist your head around
it's all around you
all is full of love
all around you
all is full of love
you just ain't receiving
all is full of love
your phone is off the hook
all is full of love
your doors are all shut
all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love

once you fell out of love
our love couldn't carry you
and i didn't even notice
for our love kept me safe from death
you doubted the light
and the shelter it can give
for in love we are immortal
eternal and safe from death
if i regret us
i'm denying my soul to grow
don't remove my pain
it is my chance to heal
we carry the same wound
but have different cures
similar injuries
but opposite remedies
after our love ended
your arms don't carry me
without love i feel the abyss
understand your fear of death
i will not forget
this notget
will you not regret
having love let go?
after our love ended
your spirit entered me
now we are the guardians
we'll keep her safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
safe, safe from...
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death
love will keep us safe from death

if you ever get close to a human
and human behaviour
be ready, be ready to get confused
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
to human behaviour
but yet so, yet so irresistible
and there is no map
they're terribly, terribly, terribly moody
oh, human behaviour
then all of a sudden turn happy
but, oh, to get involved in the exchange
of human emotions
is ever so, ever so satisfying
and there is no map
human behaviour, human, human
human behaviour, human, human
human behaviour
human behaviour, human, human
and there is no map
and a compass wouldn't help at all
human behaviour, human, human
human behaviour, human
human behaviour, human, human
human behaviour, human, human
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
human behaviour, human
human behaviour, human
human behaviour, human
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic

stand up
you've got to manage
i won't sympathize
anymore
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me
you're alright
there's nothing wrong
self-sufficience, please!
and get to work
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me, army of me
you're on your own now
we won't save you
your rescue squad
is too exhausted
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me

you'll meet an army of me, army of me

if travel is searching
and home what's been found
i'm not stopping
i'm going hunting
i'm the hunter
i'll bring back the goods
but i don't know when
i thought i could organise freedom
how scandinavian of me
you sussed it out, didn't you?
you could smell it
so you left me on my own
to complete the mission
now i'm leaving it all behind
i'm going hunting
i'm the hunter
i'm the hunter
i'm going hunting
i'm the hunter
i'm the hunter
i'm the hunter
i'm the hunter
i'm the hunter
you just didn't know me
you just didn't know me

is there a place
where i can pay respects
for the death of my family?
show some respect
between the three of us
there is the mother and the child
then there is the father and the child
but no man and a woman
no triangle of love
so, where do i go
to make an offering?
i fall on my knees
lay my flowers
burn incense
light the candles
so, where do i go
to make an offering?
to mourn our miraculous triangle?
father, mother, child
father, mother, child
how will i sing us
out of this sorrow?
build a safe bridge
for the child out of this danger, danger
i raise a monument of love
there is a swarm of sound
around our heads
and we can hear it
and we can get healed by it
it will relieve us from the pain
it will make us a part of
this universe of solutions
this place of solutions
this location of solutions

while you are away
my heart comes undone
slowly unravels
in a ball of yarn
the devil collects it
with a grin
our love
in a ball of yarn
he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love
he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love
while you are away
my heart comes undone
slowly unravels
in a ball of yarn
the devil collects it
with a grin
our love, our love
in a ball of yarn
he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love
he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love
he'll never return it
so, when you come back
we'll have to make new love
he'll never return it
so, when you come back

bird species never seen or heard before
the first flute carved from the first fauna
utopia
it’s not elsewhere
let's purify
you assigned me to protect our lantern
to be intentional about the light
utopia
it isn't elsewhere
it’s here
my instinct has been shouting at me for years
saying, "let’s get out of here!"
huge toxic tumour bulging underneath the ground here
purify, purify, purify, purify toxicity

first snow of winter
i'm walking hills and valleys
adore this mystical fog!
this fucking mist!
these cliffs are just showing off!
then the body memory kicks in
i mime my home mountains
the moss that i'm made of
i redeem myself
i've been wrestling my fate
do i accept this ending?
will i accept my death
or struggle claustrophobic?
fought like a wolverine
with my destiny
refuse to accept what was meant to be
then the body memory kicks in
and i trust the unknown
unfathomable imagination
surrender to future
oh, how to capture all this love
and find a pathway for it
like threading an ocean through a needle
river through a keyhole
can't fathom the grasp
i can't grasp the fathom
then my body memory kicks in
my limbs and tongue take over
like the ancestors before me
show me the flow
my sexual dna
x-rays of my kama sutras
summons different bodies
compares spines and buttocks
and back of necks
then my body memory kicks in
it simply takes over
bestiality
i redeem my body
i wasn't born urban
toxic doesn't agree with me
love lured me here
into a stagnant state
my myths, my customs, ridiculed
vacuum packed molecules
then my body memory kicks in
on this brooklyn dance floor
sweating with these rhythms
rotate this matrix
all trapped in legal harness
kafkaesque
farce like patriarchy
avoided to confront it
then the body memory kicks in
my warrior awakens
my turn to defend
urban didn't tame me
then my body memory kicks in
all bosoms and embraces
oral, anal entrances
enjoy the satisfaction
if the other is growing

who would have known
that a boy like him
would have entered me lightly
restoring my blisses?
who would have known
that a boy like him
after sharing my core
would stay going nowhere?
who would have known
a beauty this immense?
who would have known
a saintly trance?
who would have known
miraculous breath?
to inhale a beard
loaded with courage
who would have known
that a boy like him
possessed of magical
sensitivity?
who would approach a girl like me
who caresses, cradles his head
in her bosom?
he slides inside
half awake, half asleep
we faint back
into sleephood
when i wake up
the second time
in his arms
gorgeousness
he's still inside me
who would have known?
who, who would have known?
a train of pearls
cabin by cabin
is shot precisely
across an ocean
from a mouth
from a
from the mouth
of a girl like me
to a boy
to a boy
to a boy

we are each other’s hemispheres
i am fine tuning my soul
to the universal wavelength
no one is a lover alone
i propose an atom dance
our hearts are coral reefs in low tide
love is the ocean we crave
restlessly turning around and around
i am dancing towards transformation
learning by love to open it up
let this ugly wound breathe
we fear unconditional heart space
healed by atom dance
when you feel the flow as primal love
enter the pain and dance with me
we are each other’s hemispheres
we aim at peeling off
dead layers of loveless love
no one is a lover alone
most hearts fear their own home
most hearts, they fear their own home
becoming themselves fully
it scares them off
when you feel the flow as primal love
enter the pain and dance with me
no one is a lover alone, lone
most hearts fear their own home
you are my second hemisphere, hemisphere
the atoms are dancing, dancing
no one is a lover alone, lone
most hearts fear their own home
you are my second hemisphere, hemisphere
the atoms are dancing, dancing
atoms are laughing at last
atoms are laughing at last
at last, at last
atoms are...
no one is a lover alone
no one is a lover alone, lone
most hearts fear their own home
you are my second hemisphere, hemisphere
the atoms are dancing, dancing

we all are struggling, just doing our best
we've gone through the grinder, suffered loss
lost to, to which everything flows, an absence which
attracts floral blooming softly
soft is my chest, i didn't allow loss
loss make me hate, didn't harden from pain
this pain we have will always be there
but the sense of full satisfaction too
i opened my heart for you
your lower lip so heavy on you
my spine curved erotically
we're finally vulnerable
loss of love, we all have suffered
how we make up for it defines who we, who we are
it defines us, how we overcome it
recover, repair from loss
loss of faith just ignites survivors
they stare doubt straight into the eye
i forgive, the past is bondage
freedom aphrodisiac
i've opened my heart for you
tied ribbons on my ankles for you
drew orchids on my thighs for you
your lower lip so heavy on you
my spine curved erotically
tied ribbons on my ankles for you
drew orchids on my thighs for you
your lower lip so heavy on you
my spine curved erotically
we're finally vulnerable

i wake you up
in the middle of the night
to express my love for you
stroke your skin and feel you
naked i can feel all of you
at the same moment
i wake you up
in the night feeling
this is our last time together
therefore sensing all the moments
we've been together
being here at the same time
every single touch
we ever touch each other
every single fuck
we had together
is in a wondrous time lapse
with us here at this moment
the history of touches
every single archive
compressed into a second
all with us here as i wake you up

your flirts, it finds me out
teases the crack in me
smittens me with hope
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
as much as i definitely enjoy solitude
i wouldn't mind perhaps
spending little time with you
sometimes, sometimes
possibly maybe
probably love possibly maybe
possibly maybe
probably love possibly
uncertainty excites me, baby
who knows what's going to happen?
lottery or car crash
or you'll join a cult
probably maybe possibly maybe
possibly love
this is probably maybe possibly maybe
possibly love, possibly
mon petit vulcan
your eruptions and disasters
i keep calm
admiring your lava
i keep calm
possibly maybe
probably love possibly
possibly maybe
probably love
electric shocks
i love them!
with you, dozen a day
but after a while i wonder
where's that love you promised me? where is it?
possibly maybe
probably love possibly
possibly, possibly, possibly maybe
probably love possibly
how can you offer me love like that?
my heart's burned
how can you offer me love like that?
i'm exhausted, leave me alone
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
since we broke up
i'm using lipstick again
i suck my tongue
in remembrance of you
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe
possibly maybe

through the warmthest cord of care
your love was sent to me
i'm not sure what to do with it
or where to put it
i'm so close to tears
and so close to
simply calling you up
and simply suggesting
we go to that hidden place
that we go to that hidden place
we go to that hidden place
we go to the hidden place
now i have been slightly shy
and i can smell a pinch of hope
to almost have allowed one's fingers
to stroke the fingers i was given to touch with
but careful, careful
there lies my passion, hidden
there lies my love
i'll hide it under a blanket
lull it to sleep
i'll keep it in a hidden place
i'll keep it in a hidden place
keep it in a hidden place
keep it in a hidden place
he's the beautifullest, fragilest
still strong, dark and divine
and the littleness of his movements
hides himself
he invents a charm that makes him invisible
hides in the hair
can i hide there too?
hide in the hair of him
seek solace
sanctuary
in that hidden place
in a hidden place
in a hidden place
we'll stay in a hidden place
oh, in a hidden place
we'll live in a hidden place
we'll be in a hidden place
in a hidden place

we are all swollen
from hiding his affairs
let's put it all on the table
let it all out
it is time
he mustn't steal our light
clean plate: tabula rasa for my children
clean plate: not repeating the fuck-ups of the fathers
my deepest wish
is that you’re immersed in grace and dignity
but you will have to deal with shit soon enough
i hoped to give you the least amount of luggage
got the right to make your own fresh mistakes
and not repeat others' failures
clean plate: tabula rasa for my children
let's clean up: break the chain of the fuck-ups of the fathers
it is time: for us women to rise and not just take it lying down
it is time: the world is listening
oh, how i love you
embarrassed to pass this mess over to you
but he led two lives
thought ours was the only one
you are strong
you are strong
you are strong
you're so strong

imagine a future and be in it
feel this incredible nurture, soak it in
your past is on loop—turn it off
see this possible future and be in it
hold fort for love forever
we're just momentary vessels
we're just carrying
trust your head around
guide your stare elsewhere
your love is already waiting
you're already in it
hold fort for love forever
watch me form new nests
weave a matriarchal dome
build a musical scaffolding
between sleep and awake
day and night
between night and day
you say i mirror peoples' missions at them
now you mirror at me who i used to be
what i gave to the world
you've giving back at me
hold fort for love forever

define her abyss
show it respect
then a celestial nest
will grow above
when i'm broken, i am whole
and when i'm whole, i'm broken
our mother's philosophy
it feels like quicksand
and if she sinks
i'm going down with her
locate her black lake
the steam from this pit
will form a cloud
for her to live on
when she's broken, she is whole
and when she's whole, she's broken
our mother's philosophy
it feels like quicksand
and if she sinks
i'm going down with her
hackle this darkness
up to the light
where choreographed oxygen
embroiders the air
when we're broken we are whole
and when we're whole we're broken
we are the siblings of the sun
let's step into this beam
every time you give up
you take away our future
and my continuity and my daughter's
and her daughters
and her daughters
and her daughters

my tear duct clogged
my left eye broken
medicate with warm compress
extract hardened tears
sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
i won't denounce her origin
sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
i won't denounce our origin
i've ducked and dived
like the mother in salomon's tale
to spare our girl
i won't let her get cut in half ever
but it's time to teach her some dignity
sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
i won't denounce our origin
sue me, sue me, sue me, sue me
i won't, i won't denounce our origin
no, i won't
he took it from his father
who took it from his father
who took it from his father
let's break this curse
so it won't fall on our daughter
and her daughter
and her daughter
won't let this sink into her dna
sue me, sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
i won't let you denounce our origin
sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
denounce our origin, no, i won't
can't take her suffer
it's so unfair
the sins of the fathers
they just fucked it all up
we had the best family
we had it all
we had it all in our hands
he just pulled us through the wringer
narcissistic

my throat was stuffed
my mouth was sewn up
banned from making noise
i was not heard
remove this hindrance
my throat feels stuck
i was not allowed
i was not heard
i was not heard
i was not heard
i was not heard
there is vocal sadness
i was separated
from what i can do
what i'm capable of
need to break up
vicious habits
do something i haven't done
i haven't done before
in vow of silence
i explore the negative space
around my mouth
it implodes
black hole
with jaw fallen in
in fallen jaw
jaw fallen in
i am not hurt
i am not hurt
this tunnel has enabled
thousands of sounds
i thank this trunk
noise pipe, noise pipe
i have followed a path
that took sacrifices
now i sacrifice this scar
can you cut it off?

one hand
loves the other
so much on me
born stubborn, me
will always be
before you count "1, 2, 3"
i will have grown my own private branch
of this tree
you, gardener
you, discipliner
domestically
i can obey all of your rules
and still be, be
i never thought i would compromise
i never thought i would compromise
i never thought i would compromise
let's unite tonight
we shouldn't fight
embrace you tight
let's unite tonight
i thrive best
hermit style
with a beard and a pipe
and a parrot on each side
but now i can't do this without you
i never thought i would compromise
i never thought i would compromise
i never thought i would compromise
let's unite tonight
we shouldn't fight
embrace you tight
let's unite tonight
one hand
loves the other
so much on me
let's unite tonight
we shouldn't fight
embrace you tight
let's unite tonight
let's unite tonight
we shouldn't fight
embrace you tight
let's
ahhh...

come to me
i'll take care of you
protect you
calm, calm down
you're exhausted
come lie down
you don't have to explain
i understand
you know that i adore you
you know that i love you
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm
jump off
your building's on fire
and i'll catch you
i'll catch you
destroy all that is keeping you down
and then i'll nurse you
i'll nurse you
i'll protect you
you know that i adore you
you know that i love you
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm

i wake up
and the day feels broken
i tilt my head
i'm trying to get an angle
'cause the evening
i've always longed for
it could still happen
how do i master
the perfect day
six glasses of water
seven phone calls
if you leave it alone
it might just happen
anyway
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
well it never really was
it's not up to you
if you wake up
and the day feels a-broken
just lean into the crack
just lean into the crack
and it will tremble
ever so nicely
notice how it sparkles
down there
i can decide
what i give
but it's not up to me
what i get given
unthinkable surprises
about to happen
but what they are
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
well it never really was
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
oh it never really was
it's not up to you
oh, me, share
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
oh, it never really was
it's not up to you
well it never really was
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
it's not up to you
there's too much
clinging
to peak
there's too much
pressure

she always knows when people need stroking
and is attracted to deathbeds and divorces
i dreamt she cared for my dying grandfather
lying naked face down on his bed
she insists on total presence
and knows how to get through to the rest of us
she has entered me thousandfold often
and undone knots at my most awkward
music, music loves too
she reaches out to orphans and refugees
embraces them with thermal blankets
her favourite childhood moments
were at a hospital for the disabled
i've seen her offer empathy to widows
she attends funerals of strangers
her strongest memory
is feeding children with leprosy
music heals too
i'm here to defend it
ambassador

in a forest pitch-dark
glowed the tiniest spark
it burst into a flame
like me, like me
my name isobel
married to myself
my love isobel
living by herself
in a heart full of dust
lives a creature called lust
it surprises and scares
like me, like me
my name isobel
married to myself
my love isobel
living by herself
when she does it, she means to
moth delivers her message
unexplained on your collar
crawling in silence, a simple excuse
na na na, na na
na na na, na na
na na na, na na
na na na, na na
in a tower of steel
nature forges a deal
to raise wonderful hell
like me, like me
my name isobel
married to myself
my love isobel
living by herself
when she does it, she means to
moth delivers her message
unexplained on your collar

when i spot someone who is same height as you
and goes to same record stores
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
when i hear someone with same accent as yours
asking directions with the same beard as yours
i literally think i am five minutes away from love
isn't it odd?
isn't it peculiar?
these statistics of my mind
shuffling your features
assembling a man
googling love
warming my heart on this log fire of love
features creatures
features creatures
features creatures
features creatures
his orifices
his orifices

i can sense it
something important
is about to happen
it's coming up
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
we just met
and i know i'm a bit too intimate
but something huge is coming up
and we're both included
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality
i don't know my future after this weekend
and i don't want to
it takes courage to enjoy it
the hardcore and the gentle
big-time sensuality, sensuality

he turned me down, i then downturned another
who then downturned her
the paralyzing juice of rejection
his veins full of lead
he's left with loving what he lost
more than what he has
my snakeskin cold in the dark
but warms up in the light
i then upturned a green eyed giant
who upturned and entered me
will we stop seeing what unites us
but only what differs?
the ghosts of old loves
hovering around his orifices, his orifices...
as you narrate your own hearttale
you thread souls into one beam
the love you gave and have been given
weave into your own dream
i trust my cells to rearchive
my love historic stream

threading
the glacier head
looking hard for
moments of shine
from twilight
to twilight

i've seen it all, i have seen the trees
i've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
i've seen a man killed by his best friend
and lives that were over before they were spent
i've seen what i was — i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru!
i'm happy to say i had better to do
what about china? have you seen the great wall?
all walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!
and the man you will marry?
the home you will share?
to be honest, i really don't care...
you've never been to niagara falls?
i have seen water, it's water, that's all...
the eiffel tower, the empire state?
my pulse was as high on my very first date!
your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?
to be honest, i really don't care...
i've seen it all, i've seen the dark
i've seen the brightness in one little spark
i've seen what i chose and i've seen what i need
and that is enough, to want more would be greed
i've seen what i was and i know what i'll be
i've seen it all — there is no more to see!
you've seen it all and all you have seen
you can always review on your own little screen
the light and the dark, the big and the small
just keep in mind — you need no more at all
you've seen what you were and know what you'll be
you've seen it all — there is no more to see!

i miss you
but i haven't met you yet
so special
but it hasn't happened yet
you are gorgeous
but i haven't met you yet
i remember
but it hasn't happened yet
and if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i will meet you
i was peaking
but it hasn't happened yet
i haven't been given
my best souvenir
i miss you
but i haven't met you yet
i know your habits
but wouldn't recognise you yet
and if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i miss you
i'm so impatient
i can't stand the wait
when will i get my cuddle?
who are you?
i know by now that you'll arrive
by the time i stop waiting
i miss you

all the modern things
like cars and such
have always existed
they've just been waiting in a mountain
for the right moment
listening to the irritating noises
of dinosaurs and people
dabbling outside
engin fylgist alveg
sólin sekkur
engin sér við mér
það er sól þegar
andar inn í mér
hann bítur mig
hann bítur mig
já, hann kemur með
fylgir eftir mér

siglir eftir mér
all the modern things
have always existed
they've just been waiting
to come out
and multiply
and take over
it's their turn now
engin

you think you're denying me of something
well, i've got plenty
you're the one who's missing out
but you won't notice
until after five years
if you'll live that long
you'll wake up
all loveless
i dare you
to take me on
i dare you
to show me your palms
i'm so bored with cowards
that say they want
then they can't handle
you can't handle love
you can't handle love
you just can't handle
i dare you
to take me on
i dare you
to show me your palms
what's so scary?
not a threat in sight
you just can't handle
you can't handle love
you can't handle love
baby, you can't handle love
it's obvious
you can't handle
i dare you
to take me on
i dare you
to show me your palms
i'm so bored of cowards
that say they want
then they can't handle
you can't handle love
baby, you can't handle love
it's obvious
you can't handle
i dare you

as the lukewarm
hands of the gods
came down and gently
picked my adrenalin pearls
they placed them in their mouths
and rinsed all the fear out
nourished them with their saliva
rested
as if the healthiest past time
is being in life-threatening circumstances
and once again be reborn
all birthed and happy
all birthed and happy
all birthed and happy
all birthed and happy
all birthed and happy
all birthed and happy
best way to start-a-new
is to fail miserably
fail at loving and fail at giving
fail at creating a flow
then realign the whole
and kick into the start hole
and kick into the start hole
and kick into the start hole
to risk all is the end-all and the beginning all
to risk all is the end-all and the beginning all

not 'til you halo all over me
i'll come over
not 'til it shimmers 'round your skull
i'll be yours
i weave for you
the marvellous web
glow in the dark threads
all neon like
the cocoon surrounds you
embraces all
so you can sleep
foetus-style
and they will assist us
'cause we're asking for help
and the luminous beam - it feeds you!
the soft distortion
fills you up
nourish, nourish
your turtleheart
and they will assist us
'cause we're asking for help
and the luminous beam - it feeds you!
don't get angry with yourself
don't, don't get angry with yourself
i'll heal you
with a razor blade
i'll cut a slit open
and the luminous beam
heals you honey, heals you
don't get angry with yourself
don't get angry with yourself
don't get angry with yourself
don't get angry with yourself
i'll heal you
i'll heal you
luminous
i'll heal you

i have walked this earth
and watched people
it doesn't scare me at all
i can be sincere
and say i like them
it doesn't scare me at all
you can't say no to hope
can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
i want to go on a mountain top
with a radio and good batteries
and play a joyous tune and
free the human race
from suffering
it doesn't scare me at all
i'm no fucking buddhist
but this is enlightenment
the less room you give me
the more space i've got
it doesn't scare me at all
you can't say no to hope
can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
i want to be on a mountain top
with a radio and good batteries
and play a joyous tune and
free the human race
from suffering
it doesn't scare me at all
this is an alarm-call
so wake up, wake up now
today has never happened
and it doesn't frighten me
it doesn't scare me at all
you can't say no to hope
you can't say no to happiness
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all
it doesn't scare me at all

i wish i want to stay here
i wish this be enough
i wish i only love you
i wish simplicity
look at the speed out there
it magnetizes me to it
and i have no fear
i'm only into this to
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
i wish i'd only look
and didn't have to touch
i wish i'd only smell this
and didn't have to taste
how can i ignore?
this is sex without touching
i'm going to explore
i'm only into this to
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy

i will wade out till my thighs
are steeped in burning flowers
i will take the sun in my mouth
and leap into the ripe air alive
with closed eyes
to dash against darkness
in the sleeping curves of my body
i shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
with chasteness of seagirls
will i complete the mystery of my flesh?
will i complete the mystery of my flesh, my flesh?

i walk through this land
stake a claim
with my sense
with my bark
mark my nest with song
hear the, the echo, echo from that cliff
i draw laser line through lake
to take physicality
i inhale this physicality
this forest is in me
this forest is in me
i immerse me
this is my home
this is, this is my home

if there is a troubador washing: it is he
if there is a man about town: it is he
if there is one to be sought: it is he
if there are nine she's: they are bought for me
this way is as is she
and he placed her unclothed, long, long, long-legged
on top of the family tree
and if he has chosen the point while she is under him
then leave her coily placed crouched sucking him
for it is i
with her on knee
i leave her without pith or feel
and leave her be
leave it be, for he controls what there'll be
he makes his face known to none
for if he is seen, then all will
and all will know
know me

excuse me
but i just have to
explode
explode this body
off me
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
i'll be brand new
brand new tomorrow
a little bit tired
but brand new
oooooh
oooooh

oaaahh!!!

oh, oh
darling, stop confusing me
with your wishful thinking
hopeful embraces
don't you understand?
i have to go through this
i belong to here where
no one cares, and no one loves
no light no air to live in
a place called hate
the city of fear
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
and the hurt stops
it's sometimes just like sleeping
curling up inside my private tortures
i nestle into pain
hug suffering
caress every ache
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
it stops the hurting

like a virus needs a body
as soft tissue feeds on blood
some day i'll find you, the urge is here
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
like a mushroom on a tree trunk
as the protein transmutates
i knock on your skin, and i am in
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
the perfect match, you and me
i adapt, contagious
you open up, say welcome
like a flame that seeks explosives
as gunpowder needs a war
i feast inside you, my host is you
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
the perfect match, you and i
you fail to resist
my crystalline charm
like a virus, patient hunter
i'm waiting for you, i'm starving for you
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh
my sweet adversary, ooh
my sweet adversary, oh
my sweet adversary
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh

lately
i find myself out gazing at stars
hearing guitars
like someone in love
sometimes the things i do astound me
mostly whenever you're around me
lately
i seem to walk as though i have wings
bump into things
like someone in love
each time i look at you, i'm limp as a glove
and feeling like someone in love
sometimes the things i do astound me
mostly whenever you're around me
lately
i seem to walk as though i have wings
bump into things
like someone in love
each time i look at you, i'm limp as a glove
and feeling like someone in love

underneath our feet
crystals grow like plants
listen how they grow
i'm blinded by the lights
listen how they grow
in the core of the earth
listen how they glow
crystalline
internal nebula
crystalline
rocks growing slow-mo
crystalline
i conquer claustrophobia
crystalline
and demand the light
we mimic the openness
of the ones we love
dovetail our generosity
equalize the flow
with our hearts
we chisel quartz
to reach love
crystalline
internal nebula
crystalline
rocks growing slow-mo
crystalline
i conquer claustrophobia
crystalline
and demand the light
octagon, polygon
pipes up an organ
sonic branches
murmuring drone
crystallizing galaxies
spread out like my fingers
crystalline
internal nebula
crystalline
rocks growing slow-mo
crystalline
i conquer claustrophobia
crystalline
and demand the light
crystalline
listen how they grow

one breath away from mother oceania
your nimble feet make prints in my sands
you have done good for yourselves
since you left my wet embrace
and crawled ashore
every boy is a snake, is a lily
every pearl is a lynx, is a girl
sweet like harmony made into flesh
you dance by my side
children sublime
you show me continents
i see islands
you count the centuries
i blink my eyes
hawks and sparrows race in my waters
stingrays are floating
across the sky
little ones, my sons and my daughters
your sweat is salty
i am why, i am why
i am why
your sweat is salty
i am why, i am why
i am why, i am why

it's a hot day and i'm dressed lightly
i move carefully through the crowd
here everyone is so vulnerable

there's no-one here

crying 'cause i need you
crying i can feel you
crying 'cause i need you
crying 'cause i care
only if a ship would sail in

she touched my arm and smiled
one of these days, soon, very soon
love you 'til then, love you 'til then
feel my breath on your neck

don't say no to me
you can't say no to me
i won't see you

i'm sorry he did it
an echo, a stain
a stain
i can't say no to you
i can't say no to you

come on, girl
let's sneak out of this party
it's getting boring
there's more to life than this
it's still early morning

bærinn minn
bærinn minn og þinn
sefur sæll í kyrrð
fellur mjöll
hljótt í húmi á jörð
grasið mitt
grasið mitt og þitt
geymir mold til vors
hjúfrar lind
leynt við brekkurót
vakir eins og við
lífi trútt
kyrrlátt kalda vermsl
augum djúps
utí himinfyrrð
starir stillt um nótt
langt í burt
vakir veröld stór
grimmum töfrum tryllt
eirðarlaus
ottast nótt og dag
augu þín
ottalaus og hrein
brosa við mér björt
vonin mín
blessað brosið þitt
vekur ljóð úr værð
hvílist jörð
hljóð í örmum snæs
liljuhvít
lokar augum blám
litla stúlkan mín

i have a recurrent dream
every time i lose my voice
i swallow little glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me
during the nights
they do a trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above my bed
while i'm asleep
my mother and son pour into me
warm glowing oil
into my wide open throat
i have a recurrent dream
every time i feel a hoarseness
i swallow warm glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me, oh
they make me feel so much better
they make me feel better
we have a recurrent dream
every time we lose our voices
we dream we swallow little lights
our mother and son bakes for us
during the nights
they do a little trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above our heads
while we're asleep
my mother and son pour into us
pour into us
warm glowing oil
into our wide open throats
i have a recurrent dream
they make me feel better
they make me feel better

i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is where i'm staying
this is my home
i live by the ocean
and during the night
i dive into it
down to the bottom
underneath all currents
and drop my anchor
this is where i'm staying
this is my home

one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it will all come true
one day
when you're ready
one day, one day
when you're up to it
the atmosphere
will get lighter
and two suns ready
to shine just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day
it will happen
one day, one day
it will all make sense
one day
you will blossom
one day, one day
when you're ready
an aeroplane
will curve gracefully
around the volcano
with the eruption that never lets you down
i can feel it
i can feel it
and the beautifullest
fireworks are burning
in the sky, oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh
just for you
i can feel it
i can feel it
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
one day, one day
one day
it will all come true
one day
one day, one day

genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
so warm
sounds go through the muscles
these abstract, wordless movements
move, move, move, move, move
they start off cells that haven't been touched before
these cells are virgins
waking up slowly waking up
waking up slowly wake up
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
nothing will be the same
i'm asleep
i'm fast asleep
i like this resonance
it elevates me
i don't recognise myself
this is very interesting
my headphones
they saved my life
your tape
lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
i'm fast asleep now
you're still with me
i'm fast asleep
i'm asleep
my headphones
they saved, saved my life
your tape
it lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

i shuffle around the tectonic plates in my chest
you know i gave it all
try to match our continents
to change seasonal shift
to form a mutual core
as fast as your fingernail grows
the atlantic ridge drifts
to counteract distance
you know i gave it all
can you hear the effort
of the magnetic strife?
shuffling of columns
to form a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
you hid the key to our continuity
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know
what you resist persists
nuance makes heat
to counteract distance
i know you gave it all
offered me harmony
if things were done your way
my eurasian plate subsumed
forming a mutual core
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know that i had it in me
withheld your love, an unspent capsule
i didn't know you had it in you
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know i had it in me
this eruption undoes stagnation
you didn't know, you didn't know



his embrace, a fortress
it fuels me and places
a skeleton of trust
right beneath us
bone by bone
stone by stone
if you ask yourself patiently and carefully:
who is it? who is it?
who is it that never lets you down?
who is it that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are, they're going around
now they're handing it over
they're handing it over, handing it over
who is it that never lets you down?
who is it that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are, they're going around
now they're handing it over
handing it over
handing it over...
he demands a closeness
we all have earned a lightness
carry my joy on the left
carry my pain on the right
if you ask yourself now, patiently and carefully:
who is it?
who is it that never lets you down?
who is it that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are, they're going around
and they're handing it over
handing it over, handing
who is it that never lets you down?
who is it that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are, they're going around
now i'm handing it over
handing it over
handing it over...

since i met you
this small town hasn't got room
for my big feelings
violently happy
cause i love you
violently happy
but you're not here
violently happy
come calm me down
before i get into trouble
i tip-toe down to the shore
stand by the ocean
make it roar at me
and i roar back
violently happy
cause i love you
violently happy
but you're not here
violently happy
overemotional
violently happy
i'll get into trouble
real soon
if you don't get here
baby

violently happy
cause i love you
violently happy
i'm aiming too high
violently happy
it will get me into trouble
violently happy
i'm driving my car
too fast
with ecstatic music on
violently happy
i'm getting too drunk
violently happy
i'm daring people
to jump off roofs with me
only you
can calm me down
i'm aiming too high
soothe me

stirring at water's edge
cold froth on my twig
my mind in whirls
wanders around desire
may i, can i, or have i too often
craving miracles?
may i, can i, or have i too often now
craving miracles?
craving miracles?
no one imagines the light shock i need
and i'll never know
from whose hands, deeply humble
dangerous gifts as such to mine come
may i, should i, or have i too often
craving miracles?
may i, can i, or have i too often
craving miracles?
craving miracles?
my romantic gene is dominant
and it hungers for union
universal intimacy
all embracing
may i, should i, or have i too often
craved miracles?
may i, can i, or have i too often
craved miracles?
craved
waves irregularly striking
wind stern in my face
thunderstorm, come
scrape those barnacles of me!
may i, may i, or should i too often
crave miracles?
may i or should i or have i too often?
all my body parts are one
as lightning hits my spine
sparkling
prime runs through me
revive my wish
i am inviolable
may i, can i, or have i too often?
may i, can i, should i, or have i too often
craving miracles?

i am leaving this harbor
giving urban a farewell
its habitants seem too keen on god
i cannot stomach their rights and wrongs
i have lost my origin
and i don't want to find it again
whether sailing into nature's laws
and be held by ocean's paws
wanderlust! relentlessly craving
wanderlust! peel off the layers
until we get to the core
did i imagine it would be like this?
was it something like this i wished for?
or will i want more?
lust for comfort
suffocates the soul
relentless restlessness
liberates me sets me free
i feel at home
whenever the unknown surrounds me
i receive its embrace
aboard my floating house
wanderlust! relentlessly craving
wanderlust! peel off the layers
until we get to the core
did i imagine it would be like this?
was it something like this i wished for?
or will i want more?
wanderlust! from island to island
wanderlust! united in movement
wonderful! i'm joined with you
wanderlust!
wanderlust!
can you spot a pattern?
relentlessly restless
restless, relentlessly
restless, relentlessly
restless, relentlessly
restless, relentlessly x3
can you spot a pattern?
can you spot a pattern?

we are the earth intruders

muddy with twigs and branches
turmoil!
carnage!
here come the earth intruders
we are the paratroopers
stampede of sharp shooters
come straight from voodoo
with our feet thumping
with our feet marching
grinding skeptics
into the soil
shower of goodness coming to
end the doubt pouring over
shower of goodness coming to end
we are the earth intruders
we are the sharp shooters
flock of parachuters
necessary voodoo
i have guided my bones through some voltage
and love them still
and love them too
metallic!
carnage!
furiocity!
feel the speed!
we are the earth intruders
we are the sharp shooters
flock of parachuters
necessary voodoo
there is turmoil out there
carnage, rambling
what is to do but dig
dig bones out of earth
mud graves!
timber!
morbid trenches!
here come the earth intruders
there'll be no resistance
we are the canoneerers
necessary voodoo
and the beast
with many heads
and the arms rolling
steamroller!

heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me, make me wonder
they say back then our universe was an empty sea
until a silver fox and her cunning mate
began to sing a song that became the world we know
heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me, make me wonder
and they say back then our universe was a cold black egg
until the god inside burst out and from its shattered shell
he made what became the world we know
heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me, make me wonder
and they say back then our universe was an endless land
until our ancestors woke up and before they went back to sleep
they carved it all into the world we know
heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me, make me wonder
and they say back then our universe wasn’t even there
until a sudden bang and then there was light, was sound, was matter
and it all became the world we know
heaven, heaven’s bodies
whirl around me and dance eternal

i am strong in his hands, i am beyond me
on my own, i am human, and i do faults
i do confess, i feel you trickling
down my shoulders from above
i turn myself in, i give myself up
volunteer, you own me i'm yours
you have to trust it, i'm eternally yours
all that i gave them, i gave to you
so needy of comfort, but too raw to be embraced
undo this privacy and put me in my place
generous palmstroke: the hugest of hugs
undo this privacy, embrace
embrace me
embrace me
embrace me
em-
i am strong in his hands, i am above
way beyond me, i can't...
she's strong in his hands, she is beyond her
on her own, she is human, and she does faults
she's strong in his hands, she is beyond her
on her own, she is human, and she does faults

the pleasure is all mine
to get to be the generous one
is the strongest stance
the pleasure is all mine
to finally let go
and evenly flow
who gives most
who gives most
who gives most
the pleasure is all mine
women like us
we strengthen most
host-like
when in doubt: give
when in doubt: give
when in doubt: give

i love your eyes, my dear
their splendid sparkling fire
when suddenly you raise them so
to cast a swift embracing glance
like lightning flashing in the sky
but there's a charm that is greater still:
when my love's eyes are lowered
when all is fired by passions kiss
and through the downcast lashes
i see the dull flame of desire
and through the downcast lashes
i see the dull flame of desire
i love your eyes, my dear
their splendid, sparkling fire
when suddenly you raise them so
to cast a swift embracing glance

the nerves are sending shimmering signals
all through my fingers
the veins support
blood that gushes impulsively towards
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the stubborn trunks of these legs of mine
serve as pathways for my favourite fuel
heading upwards towards my kidneys
that celebrate
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
smooth soft red velvety lungs
are pushing a network of oxygen joyfully
through a nose, through a mouth
but all enjoys, all enjoys
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all
the triumph of a heart
that gives all, that gives all

it's tricky when
you feel someone
has done something
on your behalf
it's slippery when
your sense of justice
murmurs underneath
and is asking you:
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
with a palm full of stars
i throw them like dice repeatedly
on the table repeat, repeatedly
i shake them like dice
and throw them on the table
repeatedly repeatedly
until the desired constellation appears
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
and you hear: how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?
how am i going to make it right?

where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
my purse wide open
you ask again
i see the crime and
cash into accounts everywhere
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
i want to be flexible
i want to go out
of my way for you
but enough is enough
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
i am elastic
i want to go out
of my way for you
i want to help you
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
i want to have
capacity for you
and be elastic, laa
to be elastic, elastic for you
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
i'm elastic for you
but enough
is enough
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?
where is the line with you?

i can not live
peacefully without you
for even a moment
i miss you terribly
when you're away
he's away
this ain't right
i'm alone
i'm taking an aeroplane
across the world
to follow my heart
how come out of all the people in the world
only one can make me complete?
one word, one word on the phone
makes me happy
one touch, but one touch directly
makes me ecstatic
he's away
this ain't right
i'm alone
i'm taking an aeroplane
across the world
to follow my heart

why can't you give her room?
respect her spatial needs
i feel you compress her
into a small space
with clairvoyance
she knew what you needed
and she gave it to you
now her desires are repressed
arrows in the flesh
when she, when she found your love
her nature bowed her head
she surrendered
she renounced the world for you
now she’s poisoned by demands
you cannot answer
why this sacrifice?
now she regrets the whole thing
a delayed reaction
when she left her craft voluntarily
for your nest, for your love
did you understand?
appreciate
build a bridge to her
initiate a touch
before it’s too late
say the words to her
that will make her shine
tell her that you love her
your generosity will show
in the volume of her glow
your generosity will show
in the volume of her glow
your generosity will show
in the volume of her glow

i remember you
you're the one that made my dreams come true
a few kisses ago
i remember you
you're the one that said, "i love you too
didn't you know?"
i remember too
a distant bell
and stars that fell
like rain, out of the blue
when my life is through
and the angels ask me to recall
the thrill of them all
i shall tell them: i remember you, you, you, you
i remember you
you're the one that made my dreams come true
a few kisses ago
i remember you
you're the one that said, "i love you too
didn't you know?"
i remember too
a distant bell
and stars that fell
like rain, out of the blue
when my life is through
and the angels ask me to recall
the thrill of them all
i shall tell them: i remember you
oh, you
oh, you
you

while i crawl into the unknown
cover me
i'm going hunting for mysteries
cover me
i'm going to prove the impossible exists
this is really dangerous
cover me
but worth all the effort
cover me
i'm going to prove the impossible really exists

there is yet another one
that follows me
wherever i go
and supports me
all this tooth is warmth-like
this tooth is warmth-like
this tooth is warmth-like
and these teeth are a ladder up to his mouth
all these teeth are a ladder that i walk
that you can walk too if you want
if you want up to the mouth
the mouth's cradle
up to the mouth's cradle
he always has a hope for me
always sees me when nothing else
and everyone have left
that ghost is brighter than anyone
and fulfills me with hope
those beams assure me
and you can use these teeth as a ladder
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
and you can follow these notes i'm singing
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
the simplicity of the ghost-like beast
the purity of what it wants and where it goes
always love, always loves you, always loves you
infrared love
and you can use those teeth as a ladder
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
and you can use those teeth, oh, follow my voice
tooth by tooth
up to the mouth's cradle, the mouth's cradle
i need a shelter to build an altar away
from all osamas and bushes
i need a shelter to build an altar away
from all osamas and bushes

i once had no fears
none at all
and then when
i had some
to my surprise
i grew to like both
scared or brave
without them
the thrill of fear
thought i'd never admit it
the thrill of fear
now greatly enjoyed with courage
when i once was
untouchable
innocence roared
still amazes
when i once was
innocent
it is still here
but in different places
neurosis
only
attaches
itself to
fertile
ground
where it can flourish
the thrill of fear
thought i'd never admit it
the thrill of fear
now greatly enjoyed with courage
when i once was
fearless
innocence roared
still amazes
untouchable
innocence
it is still here
but in different places
fear is a powerful drug
overcome it and
you think that you can do
anything
should i
save myself
for later
or generously give?
fear of
losing
energy
is draining
it locks up your chest
shuts down the heart
miserly
and stingy
let's open up: share!
when i once was
fearless
innocence roared
still amazes
untouchable
innocence
it is still here
but in different places

i'm so broken

this aeroplane of ours gracefully
but it seems just destined to crash
i'm so broken
heðan-biður-afte-care

get over the sorrow, girl
the world is always going to be made of this
you can trust in it
unless you breathe in
bravely
i adore how you simply surrender to high
and your lungs, they're mourning
t-b style
all the stillborn love that could've happened
all the moments you should have embraced
all the moments you should have not locked up
understand so clearly:
to shut yourself up
would be the hugest crime of them all
hugest crime of them all
you're just crying after all
to not want them humans around
anymore
get over that sorrow, girl
get over it

hollow
my ancestors have access
hollow
i'm falling down the abyss
hollow
looking for some answers
generations of mothers sailing in
somehow they all were shipfolks
hollow
the ground is opening up
swallows me up
the trunk of dna
the trunk of dna, trunk
now come forth, all species
hollow
like a bead in necklace
thread me upon this chain
i'm part of it, ohh
the everlasting necklace
jewels after jewels after jewels after
jewels after jewels after jewels
i yearn to belong
let me belong
let me belong

up on the toe
there is a view
up on the toe
and the spine
straight and erect
hungry and curious
up on the toe
looking forward to
the air is thinner here
she came here
to lose face
got down on her knees
the beast is back!
on four legs
set her clock to the moon
raises her spine
vertebrae by vertebrae
up on the toe
looking
i have been filled with steam for months, for years
same old cloud, claustrophobic me
let it burst like old train sounds
make them leave me nature
vertebrae by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
my arms ooze out of my shoulders!
and the arms ooze out of my shoulders
i curl my tail inwards, inwards
i set my clock on the moon
vertebrae by vertebrae
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
please release this pressure of me
let off some steam

here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind
here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind
here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind
what's the lesser of two evils
if a suicide bomber made to look pregnant
manages to kill her target or not?
what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if she kills them or dies in vain?
nature has fixed no limits on our hopes
oh, what's the lesser of two evils?
what's the lesser of two evils
if her bump was fake or if it was real?
here's my version of it
eternal whirlwind
i have fostered since childhood
well, i don't care
love is all
i dare to drown
to be proven wrong

when your eyes pause on the ball
that hangs on the third branch from the star
you remember why it is dark
and why it gets light again
the earth, like the heart, slopes in its seat
and, like that, it travels along an elliptical path
drawn into the darkness
an unpolished pearl
in sky-black palm of hand
flickering sun-flame
and then you remember
that you, yourself, you are a light-bearer, a light-bearer
receiving radiance from others
flickering sun-flame
unpolished earth in palm of hand

show me forgiveness
for having lost faith in myself
and let my own interior up
to inferior forces
the shame is endless
but if soon start forgiveness
the girl might live

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you
i see who you are
i see who you.... are...

it may not always be so
and i say that if your lips
which i have loved
should touch another's
and your dear strong fingers clutch her heart
as mine in time not far away
if on another's face your sweet hair lay
in such a silence as i know
or such great writhing words as, uttering overmuch
stand helplessly before the spirit at bay
if this should be, i say if this should be
you of my heart, send me a little word
that i may go unto her, and take her hands saying
accept all happiness from me
then i shall turn my face
and hear one bird sing terribly afar in the lost lands

when will it be time to document?
do it now!
this submarine behaviour
do it now!
when time?
do it now!
to return
do it now!
do it now!
shake us out of the heavy deep sleep
shake us now!
do it now!
do it now!
shake us out of the heavy deep sleep
do it now!

down the corridor
i send warmth
i send warmth
down the staircase
i send warmth
i send warmth
thank you for, again
to get to be able
to send warmth
to send warmth
perhaps i set you too free
too fast
too young
but the intentions were pure
but the intentions were pure
my juvenile
my juvenile
my juvenile
i truly say
you are my biggest love
i clumsily try to free you from me
one last embrace
to tie a sacred ribbon
this is an offer to better the last let-go
this is an offer to better the last let-go
this is an offer to better the last let-go
the intentions were pure
my juvenile

look no further
look no further
look no further
cruelest, almost
always to ourselves
it mustn't
get any better off
it's in our hands: it always was
it's in our hands: in our hands
it's all there: in our hands
it's all there: in our hands
well, now aren't we scaring ourselves
unnecessarily?
aren't we trying too hard?
'cause it's in our hands: it's in our hands
it's all here: it's in our hands
look no further
look no further
it's in our hands: it always was
it's in our hands
it's in our hands: it's in our hands
it's in our hands

i go humble
you're so curiously pure
only before you i'm humble
i go humble
you amaze me
only before you i'm humble
i should be arrested
for my emotional stunts
only before you i'm humble
i'm queen of provocation
i wake people up
only before you i'm humble
i go humble
i adore you
only before you i'm humble
i should be arrested
for my emotional stunts
only before you i'm humble

black night is falling
the sun is gone to bed
the innocent are dreaming
as you should, sleepy-head
sleepy-head, sleepy-head:
all the love above
i send into you
comfort and protection
i'll watch over you
but don't ask me
what's gonna happen next
i know the future
i'd love to lead you the way
just to make it easier on you
you are gonna have to find out for yourself
you are gonna have to find out for yourself
you are gonna have to find out for yourself
you are gonna have to find out for yourself
my dearest scatterheart
there is comfort
right in the eye
of the hurricane
just to make it easier on you
you are gonna have to find out for yourself
you are gonna have to find out for yourself
you are gonna have to find out for yourself
you are gonna have to find out for yourself
all the hurt in the world
you know
there's nothing i'd love to do more
than spare you from that burden
it's gonna be hard
if i only could
shelter you
from that pain
just to make it easier on you
you are gonna have to find out for yourself

train-whistles, a sweet clementine
blueberries, dancers in line
cobwebs, a bakery sign
oh - a sweet clementine
oh - dancers in line
oh
if living is seeing
i'm holding my breath
in wonder - i wonder
what happens next?
a new world, a new day to see
see, see
i'm softly walking on air
halfway to heaven from here
sunlight unfolds in my hair
oh - i'm walking on air
oh - to heaven from here
oh
if living is seeing
i'm holding my breath
in wonder - i wonder
what happens next?
a new world, a new day to see

he means tomorrow but says, "in a bit"
and doesn't show up at all
he sets his watch to a comet's orbit
and remembers to forget to call
no courage for love, too scared to be happy
no courage for love, too scared to be happy
i do, do
i do, do
"your place or mine?" means "heaven or hell?"
two addresses somewhat apart
his home's dark and spiky, her's clear as a bell
it's over before they can start
no courage for love, too scared to be happy
no courage for love, too scared to be happy
i do, don't
i do, don't
and tomorrow passed them by
and tomorrow passed them by
and tomorrow passed them by
and tomorrow passed them by

with our fingers, we make million holes
we run and we fall into potholes
on a mission to savor the world, oh!
we peek at the sky through tree holes
comet! oh, damn it!
the comet comes hurtling down
on a precious plot of earth
like the bugs in mother's flower bed
we walk on long legs over the sea bed
on our mission to save the world, oh!
we need milk and cakes and a warm bed
the comet! oh, damn it!
the comet comes hurtling down
on a precious plot of earth
grey leaves are too much
for any mother to handle
a father must pull
his black hat down over the eyes

oh boy
where have i put my keys?
i've looked in my pocket
behind the newspaper
and underneath the remote control
and i cannot find where i put it again
oh boy
i cannot find my keys
i'm far too late
the door is open now
a taxi is waiting there
a phone keeps ringing
i'm definitely not going to pick it up
'cause when i grow up
i'm gonna get those fancy keyrings
that you whistle at
and they whistle right back at you

i know i've been tolerant 'til now
but here comes a warning
there's a very clear line that i'm drawing
and if you cross it

your third-class communication
and bulldoze over all my sensitivities
you've read me all wrong

sunday is gloomy, the hours are slumberless
dearest of shadows i live with are numberless
little white flowers will never awaken you
not where the dark coach of sorrow has taken you
angels have no thought of ever returning you
would they be angry if i thought of joining you?
gloomy sunday
gloomy sunday, with shadows i spend it all
my heart and i have decided to end it all
soon there'll be prayers and candles are lit, i know
let them not weep, let them know that i'm glad to go
death is a dream, for in death i'm caressing you
with the last breath of my soul, i'll be blessing you
gloomy sunday
dreaming
i was only dreaming
i awake and i find you asleep and deep in my heart
dear
darling, i hope that my dream hasn't haunted you
my heart is telling you how much i wanted you
gloomy sunday
it's absolutely gloomy sunday
gloomy sunday
sunday

i miss you
but i haven't met you yet
you felt gorgeous
but i haven't met you yet
i remember
but it hasn't happened yet
so special
but it hasn't happened yet
and if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i will meet you
i was peaking
but it hasn't happened yet
i haven't been given
my best souvenir
i miss you
but it hasn't happened yet
i know your habits
but wouldn't recognise you yet
and if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i, i, i, i miss you
i had a dream that i was missing you, indeed
and if i miss you then you know that i'll be there with speed
i got that mystical vibe for your mind, believe
i've never seen you but i've seen you got the vibes i need
that's why i miss ya, can't dismiss ya from my mind miss you
only  ya but i seek to find
you got to send me an emotion, or a sign
'cause even though we know all things must reveal in time
still i miss ya miss you, miss you
i get so impatient
i can't stand the wait
when will i get my cuddle?
who are you?
i know by now that you'll arrive
by the time i stop waiting
miss you
i miss you
so, i miss you
i miss you
miss you, miss you, miss you
miss you, miss you

why do i love it so much?
what kind of magic is this?
how come i can't help adore it?
it's just another musical
no one minds it at all
if i'm having a ball
this is a musical
and there's always someone
to catch me
there's always someone to catch me
there's always someone to catch me
there's always someone to catch me
when you fall
why do i love you so much?
what kind of magic is this?
how come i can't help adore you?
you were in a musical
i don't mind it at all
if i'm having a ball
this is a musical!
and you were always there
to catch me
you were always there to catch me
you were always there to catch me
you were always there to catch me
when i fall...
i don't mind it at all
if you're having a ball
this is a musical!
and i will always be there to catch you
i'll always be there to catch you
i'll always be there to catch you
i'll always be there to catch you
i'll always be there to catch you
you were always there to catch me
and there's always someone
to catch me
you will always be there to catch me
you were always there to catch me
when i'd fall...

dear general macarthur
with your permission
i offer wishes of good health
during this heat
that burns anything
the words i slowly put together
do not flow easily, they only fill my heart
recently, fulfilling
your heart's desire
you removed the whaling
moratorium
your gesture brings
a much needed food
to our community
and families
the words i slowly put together
do not flow easily, they only fill my heart
a million year old fossil
i send to you
this comes from my family
and the ancient sea
a prehistoric impression
of the modern krill
she feeds the noble whale
and offers you longevity
the words i slowly put together
do not flow easily, they only fill my heart
finally, please take good care in the heat
sincerely yours
shizuka

it's wet in the middle
with a shell around it
it's called "life"
it goes wherever it wants to
don't try to predict it
then you'd offend it
it's meant to surprise
nature is ancient ancient
but surprises us all ancient
nature is ancient ancient
but surprises us all ancient
rescue me
from level-head-ness
and the unnecessary luxury of being calm
nature is ancient ancient
but surprises us all ancient
nature is ancient ancient
but surprises us all ancient
she's got dark hairs on her head;
blonde on her arms;
she sneaks up from behind
come on, you deserve it!
nature is ancient ancient
but surprises us all ancient
nature is ancient ancient
but surprises us all ancient
nature is ancient ancient
surprises us all ancient
nature is ancient ancient
surprises us all ancient
nature is ancient ancient, ancient
so ancient ancient, ancient
nature is ancient ancient, ancient
ancient

i adore
back of necks
beautifully shaven
gives me
always, always, always, always, always, always
a pretty rush down my spine
all those boys
with fascinating fingers
working, creating
touching their tools
gives me
always, always, always, always, always, always
a pretty rush down my spine
tell me stories
play me the tunes
that crack you up
gives me
always, always, always, always, always, always, always
a pretty rush down my spine

foot soldier
march ahead
enter the unknown
you will take the first step
foot soldier
blindfolded
you're babystepping
carefully treading
blindfolded
treading carefully
conquer the darkness
into the darkness
foot soldier
and then we'll follow
but you go first
march ahead
but you go first
foot soldier
march ahead
foot soldier
march ahead
foot soldier
march ahead
foot soldier
who will take the first step?

this mood might not happen often that i feel
i might breathe heavily, darling
but there’s so much hope
there is so much hope out there
i’ve been trying so hard
to complete all the puzzles
to create a flow
to get the current
the warmths we all know
the nurishment we all want feed on
we want to feed on
and then only sometime
with the right amount of tears in our eyes
and smiles on our lips
trance-like
we know, we know
we know it was all worth it
we know, we know
it was all for reason
let’s elevate, let's elevate
let's elevate above now, now, now, now, now!

vessel, host, occidental guests
figure and field, both, carrier, carried
holographic paradigm
the whole in every part
warm, viscous body, cooling
in marine air embrace
curing, skinning over
a still molten core
vessel, host, occidental guests
skin seascape in suspension
holographic entrypoint
each part reflects the whole
skin slit, consensual knife
she cuts his figure, he flenses her field
external resistance freeing
internal relation emerging
vessel, host, occidental guests
to pattern, comes blood, giving form
holographic condition
the whole in every part
warm blood, terrestrial guests
take to the southern sea, breathing
antarctic host and vessel, proud
cetacean guests returning

black night is falling
the sun is gone to bed
the innocent are dreaming
as you should, sleepy head
sleepy head, sleepy head
does it hurt?
i hurt you much more
so don't you worry
i don't know what to do
everything just feels so wrong
everything is fine
just stay strong
silly selma, you're the one to blame
you just did what you had to do
you just did what you had to do
you just did what you had to do
you just did what you had to do
the time it takes a tear to fall
a snake to shed its skin
is all the time that's needed
to forgive, forgive me
you are forgiven
come on, hurry
i killed your man
you have to hurry up
i called the police
they're just down the road
they've come for me
why should i run?
they'll take your money
run for your boy
silly selma, you're the one to blame
you just did what you had to do
you just did what you had to do
you just did what you had to do
you just did what you had to do
the time it takes a tear to fall
a heart to miss a beat
a snake to shed its skin
a rose to grow a thorn
is all the time that's needed
to forgive me
i am so sorry
i just did what i had to do
i just did what i had to do
i just did what i had to do
i just did what i had to do

anyone who ever loved
could look at me
and know that i love you
anyone who ever dreamed
could look at me
and know i dream of you
knowing i love you so
anyone who had a heart
would take me in his arms and love me, too
you wouldn't really have a heart
and hurt me like you hurt me
and be so untrue
what am i to do?
every time you go away
i always say:
"this time it's goodbye, dear"
loving you the way i do
i take you back
without you i'd die, dear
knowing i love you so
anyone who had a heart
would take me in his arms and love me, too
you couldn't really have a heart
and hurt me like you hurt me
and be so untrue
what am i to do?
knowing i love you so
anyone who had a heart
would take me in his arms and love me, too
you couldn't really have a heart
and hurt me like you hurt me
and be so untrue
anyone who ever had a heart
would then take me in his arms
and always love me
why don't you?
anyone who had a heart
would always take me in his arms
and always love me
why don't you?
anyone who ever had a heart
he would take me in his arms
and always love me
why don't you?

i can't get no... satisfaction
i can't get no... satisfaction
and i try
and i try
and i try
and i try
i can't get no...
no no no
when i'm drivin' in my car
and the man comes on the radio
he's tellin' me more and more
about some useless information
designed to
fire my imagination
i can't get no
no, no, no
hey, hey, hey
that's what i say
i can't get no satisfaction
i can't get no satisfaction
and i try, and i try
and i try, and i try
when i'm ridin' 'round the world
and i'm doin' this and i'm signin' that
and i'm tryin' to make some dough, tell me
baby, better come back, maybe next week
'cause you see i'm on a losing streak
i can't get no
oh, no, no, no
hey, hey, hey
i can't get no
that's what i say
satisfaction
hey, hey, hey
that's what i say
i can't get no

day after day
alone on a hill
the strange guy
where the rooster crowed
no one wants to know about him
and they point where he goes
he still holds out alone
do you know about a fool on a hill
he can see a precious sun
and his eyes see more
they see a world, a hidden world
ask him for help
he comes quickly
he that has thousand voices
whisper the truth quickly
no one wants to listen to him
or the sound in a secret song
which he doesn't know at all
do you know about a fool on a hill
no one wants to see him
in the hut in the south with a lake
he still holds out alone

no one wants to listen to him
and they point where he goes
he still holds out alone

down in the cellar in the boho zone
i went looking for some sweet inspiration, oh well
just another hard time band with negro affectations
i was a hopeful in rooms like this
when i was working cheap
it's an old romance, the boho dance
hasn't gone to sleep
but even on the scuffle
the cleaner's press was in my jeans
and any eye for detail
caught a little lace along the seams
and you were in the parking lot
subterranean by your own design
the virtue of your style inscribed
on your contempt for mine
jesus was a beggar, he was rich in grace
and solomon kept his head in all his glory
it's just that some steps outside the boho dance
have a fascination for me
a camera pans the cocktail hour
behind a blind of potted palms
and finds a lady in a paris dress
with runs in her nylons
you read those books where luxury
comes as a guest to take a slave
books where artists in noble poverty
go like virgins to the grave
don't you get sensitive on me
'cause i know you're just too proud
you couldn't step outside the boho dance now
even if good fortune allowed
like a priest with a pornographic watch
looking and longing on the sly
sure it's stricken from your uniform
but you can't get it out of your eyes
nothing is capsulized in me
on either side of town
the streets were never really mine
not mine, not mine, these glamor gowns

all of my mouth was kissing him
now, into the air, i am missing him
is this excess texting a blessing?
two music nerds obsessing
he reminds me of the love in me
i'm celebrating on a vibrancy
sending each other mp3s
falling in love to a song
this handsomest of wickermen
he asked if i could wait for him
now, how many lightyears this interim
while i fall in love with his songs?
his hands are good in protecting me
touching and caressing me
but would it be trespassing
wanting him to be blissing me
robbing him of his youth?
cliffhanger like suspension
my longing has formed its own skeleton
bridging the gap between singletons
sending each others these songs
the interior of these melodies
is perhaps where we are meant to be
our physical union a fantasy
i just fell in love with a song
so, i reserve my own intimacies
i bundle them up in packages
my rawward longing far too visceral
did i just fall in love with love?

the hunted look, the haunted grace
the empty laugh that you cultivate
you fall into that false embrace
and kiss the air about her face
who do you think you are?
the très bon mots you almost quote from your
quiver of literary darts
a thousand or so tuneless violins
thrilling your cheap little heart
who do you think you are?
my cigarette burns right down to the ash
my coffee cup is unstained
the waiter hovers close at hand
his courtesy strained
who do you think you are?
i close with my regards
well i'm the red-face gentleman
caught in this picture postcard
who do you think you are?
i'm trying my best to make the best of your absence
though the joke gets tired and sordid
sea-shell hearts get trampled under foot
punchlines unrewarded
but even at this distance
it's not easy to accept
the vision that i chase returns
when i least expect it
i've fallen from your tired embrace
i kiss the air
around the place
that should be
your face

stand up
you've got to manage
i won't sympathize
anymore
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me
you're all right
there's nothing wrong
self-sufficience please!
and get to work
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me
and if you complain once more
you'll meet an army of me, army of me
army of me

when you're alone and life is making you lonely
you can always go downtown
when you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
seems to help, i know downtown
just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
how can you lose?
the lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
so go downtown
things'll be great when you're downtown
no finer place, for sure, downtown
everything's waiting for you
don't hang around and let your problems surround you
there are movie shows downtown
maybe you know some little places to go to
where they never close downtown
just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
you'll be dancing with him too before the night is over
happy again
the lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
so go downtown
where all the lights are bright downtown
waiting for you tonight downtown
you're gonna be all right now
and you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
guide them along
so maybe i'll see you there
we can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares
so go downtown
things'll be great when you're downtown
don't wait a minute for downtown
everything's waiting for you

come on girl
let's sneak out of this party
it's getting boring
there's more to life than this
it's still early morning
we could go down to the harbor
and jump between the boats
and see the sun come up
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
we could nick a boat
and sneak off to this island
i could bring my little ghetto blaster
there's more to life than this
but we'd have to rush back
to the town's best baker
to get the first bread of the morning
there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life
you know there's more to life than this
you know there's more to life

ég var á vappi niðri við höfn - á bryggjunni stóð hann
hann sagði mér frá landi einu, langt af leið það er
on nú er eins og eitthvað hafi brostið inní mér
alta mira - ævintýralanið er
alta mira - þangað hugurinn mig ber
alta mira - ævintýralanið er
alta mira - þangað hugurinn mig ber
sá gamli sagði mer þar sólin sægræn væri á lit
i sjónum spekingslegar syntu kýrnar út á hlið
hann seli sá í söngleik í silfurtitum skóm
um torgin töltu tífælur í kjólfötum með blóm
alta mira - ævintýralanið er
alta mira - þangað hugurinn mig ber
alta mira - ævintýralanið er
alta mira - þangað hugurinn mig ber
hæ - alta mira - lalalalala-lala







drengurrin litli hann krýpur á knéð
krossleggur hendurnar svo guð fái séð
uss - hljótt - hvað?
drengurrin litli sem bænir fer með
góði guð farðu ei mömmu frá
hún háttar mig og baðar og er mér hjá
svo klærðir hún mig í náttföt hlý
guð blessið pabba ég gleymdi því
þegar hugsa ég um hvað sem gerðist í dag
kemur upp í huga mér lítið lag
ég má ei hætta bænina við
fyrigefðu guð, ég vel þig bið
náttfötin mín eru hettu með
í hettuni höfuðið vel ég fel
hún augu mín hylur og ennið með
enginn veit að ég þar er
þákka þér guð fyrir góðan dag
gleymdi ég einhverju, hvað var það?
ég bad fyrir pabba og hugsaði um þig
já nú man ég - guð blessi mig
drengurrin litli han sefur nú rótt
dagurrin liðinn, komin er nótt
uss - hljótt - hvað?
drengurrin litli sem bænirnar bað
the little boy he crawls to his knees
crosses his hands so that god can see
hush - quiet - what?
the little boy who says his prayers
good god don't go away from mommy
she undresses me and bathes and stays with me
then she dresses me in warm nightgown
god bless daddy 'cause i forgot
when i think of what happened today
a little song comes to mind
i must not stop saying my prayer
forgive me god, i ask you kindly
my nightgown has a hood
inside the hood i hide my head
it covers my eyes and my forehead as well
nobody knows that i am there
thank you god for a good day
did i forget something, what was it?
i prayed for daddy and thought of you
yes now i remember - god bless me
the little boy sleeps well now
the day is over, the night has come
hush - quiet - what?
the little boy who said his prayers

my little girl, who plays so well
the day has passed and the night has come
time now to take your clothes off
wash the fingers, or what do you think?
give me a pillow and give me a blanket
give me a bed that has two sets of wings
there i will fly in the home of my mind
and go in a dream to the huge universe
then fly my friend in the mind
visit venus and mercury
there you will meet a beautiful wife
who brings you presents, or what do you think?
from earth the the route leads to mars
where shoals of trouts and salmon play
delays are expected at jupiter's moon
and, or what do you think?
give me a pillow and give me a blanket
in saturn they dance around the clock
shot the clubs with a uranus swing
in neptune city you may build your home
and travel to pluto, or what do you think?

i love your eyes, my dear
their splendid sparkling fire
when suddenly you raise them so
to cast a swift embracing glance
like lightning flashing in the sky
but there's a charm that is greater still:
when my love's eyes are lowered
when all is fired by passions kiss
and through the downcast lashes
i see the dull flame of desire
and through the downcast lashes
i see the dull flame of desire
i love your eyes, my dear
their splendid, sparkling fire
when suddenly you raise them so
to cast a swift embracing glance
like lightning flashing in the sky
but there's a charm that is greater still:
when my love's eyes are lowered
when all is fired by passions kiss
and through the downcast lashes
i see the dull flame of desire
and through the downcast lashes
i see the dull flame of desire
dull flame
i see the dull flame of desire
i see the dull flame
i see the dull flame
i love your eyes, my dear
their splendid, sparkling fire
when suddenly you raise them so
to cast a swift embracing glance
like lightning flashing in the sky
but there's a charm that is greater still:
when my love's eyes are lowered
when all is fired by passions kiss
and through the downcast lashes
i see the dull flame of desire
through the downcast lashes
i see the dull flame of desire
see the dull flame
i see the full flame of
i see the dull flame
i see the full flame
i love your eyes, my dear
their splendid, sparkling fire
when suddenly you raise them so
to cast a swift embracing glance
like lightning flashing in the sky
but there's a charm that is greater still:
when my love's eyes are lowered
when all is fired by passions kiss
through the downcast lashes
i see the dull flame of desire
and through the downcast lashes
i see the dull flame of desire
and through the
downcast lashes
i see the
dull flame
of

your building's on fire
i'll catch you

i see who you are
behind the skin
and the muscles
i see who you are, now
and when you get older later
i will see the same girl
the same soul
lioness, fireheart
passionate lover
and afterwards
later this century
when you and i have become corpses
let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
let me push you up against me tightly
and enjoy every bit of you

we live on a mountain
right at the top
there's a beautiful view
from the top of themountain
everymorning i walktowards the edge
and throw little thingsoff
like car parts, bottles and cutlery
or whatever i find lying around
it's become a habit
a way to start the day
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
it's real early morning
no one is awake
i'm back at my cliff
still throwing things off
i listen to sounds they make
on their way down
i follow with my eyes till they crash
i imagine what my body would sound like
slamming against those rocks
and when it lands
will my eyes be closed or open?
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
i go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
safe up here with you
