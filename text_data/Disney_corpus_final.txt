how are you doing that?
it's a magic carpet
i-it's lovely...
you don't...you don't wanna go for a ride, do you?
we could get out of the palace, see the world
is it safe?
sure, do you trust me?
what?
do you trust me?
yes...
i can show you the world
shining, shimmering, splendid
now tell me, princess, now when did
you last let your heart decide?
i can open your eyes
take you wonder by wonder
over, sideways and under
on a magic carpet ride
a whole new world
a new fantastic point of view
no one to tell us, "no"
or where to go
or say we're only dreaming
a whole new world
a dazzling place i never knew
but when i'm way up here
it's crystal clear
that now i'm in a whole new world with you
now i'm in a whole new world with you
unbelievable sights
indescribable feeling
soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
through an endless diamond sky
a whole new world
don't you dare close your eyes
a hundred thousand things to see
hold your breath; it gets better
i'm like a shooting star
i've come so far
i can't go back to where i used to be
a whole new world
every turn, a surprise
with new horizons to pursue
every moment, red-letter
i'll chase them anywhere
there's time to spare
let me share this whole new world with you
a whole new world
a whole new world
that's where we'll be
that's where we'll be
a thrilling chase
a wondrous place
for you and me 
you know i am a righteous man
of my virtue i am justly proud
et tibi pater
beata maria
you know i'm so much purer than
the common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd
quia peccavi nimis
then tell me, maria
why i see her dancing there
why her smoldering eyes still scorch my soul
i feel her, i see her
the sun caught in her raven hair
is blazing in me out of all control
like fire
hellfire
this fire in my skin
this burning
desire
is turning me to sin
it's not my fault
mea culpa
i'm not to blame
it is the gypsy girl
the witch who sent this flame
mea maxima culpa
it's not my fault
mea culpa
if in god's plan
he made the devil so much
stronger than a man
mea maxima culpa
protect me, maria
don't let this siren cast her spell
don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone
destroy esmeralda
and let her taste the fires of hell
or else let her be mine and mine alone
hellfire
dark fire
now gypsy, it's your turn
choose me or
your pyre
be mine or you will burn
god have mercy on her
kyrie eleison
god have mercy on me
kyrie eleison
but she will be mine
or she will burn! maybe he's right. maybe there is something the matter with me
i just don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad...
sung

look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
wouldn't you think i'm the girl, the girl who has everything?
look at this trove, treasures untold
how many wonders can one cavern hold?
looking around here you think
"sure, she's got everything"
i've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty
i've got whozits and whatzits galore
you want thingamabobs? i've got twenty!
but who cares? no big deal, i want more
i wanna be where the people are
i wanna see, wanna see them dancin'
walking around on those - what do you call 'em? oh - feet!
flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
legs are required for jumping, dancing
strolling along down a - what's that word again? street
up where they walk, up where they run
up where they stay all day in the sun
wanderin' free - wish i could be
part of that world
what would i give if i could live out of these waters?
what would i pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
bet'cha on land they understand
bet they don't reprimand their daughters
bright young women sick of swimmin'
ready to stand
i'm ready to know what the people know
ask 'em my questions and get some answers
what's a fire and why does it - what's the word? burn?
when's it my turn?
wouldn't i love, love to explore that shore up above?
out of the sea, wish i could be part of that world 

i can see what's happening what?
and they don't have a clue who?
they'll fall in love and here's the bottom line - our trio's down to two. oh.
in a sarcastic mock-french accent
ze sweet caress of twilight
back to normal, but still sarcastic
there's magic everywhere
and with all this romantic atmosphere
disaster's in the air
can you feel the love tonight?
the peace the evening brings
the world, for once, in perfect harmony
with all its living things
so many things to tell her
but how to make her see
the truth about my past? impossible!
she'd turn away from me
he's holding back, he's hiding
but what, i can't decide
why won't he be the king i know he is
the king i see inside?
can you feel the love tonight?
the peace the evening brings
the world, for once, in perfect harmony
with all its living things
can you feel the love tonight?
you needn't look too far
stealing through the night's uncertainties
love is where they are
and if he falls in love tonight
it can be assumed
his carefree days with us are history
in short: our pal is doomed hakuna matata! what a wonderful phrase!
hakuna matata! ain't no passing craze!
it means no worries, for the rest of your days...
it's our problem-free philosophy...
hakuna matata!
why, when he was a young warthog...
when i was a young warthog...
very nice
thanks
he found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
he could clear the savannah after every meal
i'm a sensitive soul though i seem thick-skinned
and it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
and, oh, the shame!
he was ashamed
thought of changin' my name!
oh, what's in a name?
and i got downhearted
how did ya feel?
everytime that i...
hey! pumbaa! not in front of the kids!
oh. sorry...
hakuna matata! what a wonderful phrase
hakuna matata! ain't no passing craze
it means no worries for the rest of your days
yeah, sing it, kid!
it's our problem-free
philosophy
hakuna matata!
hakuna matata!
hakuna matata!
hakuna matata!
hakuna...
it means no worries for the rest of your days
it's our problem-free philosophy
hakuna matata!

prince ali!
amorous he! ali ababwa

and that, good people, is why he got dolled up and dropped by
with 60 elephants, llamas galore
with his bears and lions
a brass band and more
with his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers
his birds that warble on key
make way for prince ali! you think i'm an ignorant savage
and you've been so many places
i guess it must be so
but still i cannot see
if the savage one is me
how can there be so much that you don't know?
you don't know...
you think you own whatever land you land on
the earth is just a dead thing you can claim
but i know every rock and tree and creature
has a life, has a spirit, has a name
you think the only people who are people
are the people who look and think like you
but if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
you'll learn things you never knew you never knew
have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
come taste the sunsweet berries of the earth
come roll in all the riches all around you
and for once, never wonder what they're worth
the rainstorm and the river are my brothers
the heron and the otter are my friends
and we are all connected to each other
in a circle, in a hoop that never ends
how high does the sycamore grow?
if you cut it down, then you'll never know
and you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
for whether we are white or copper skinned
we need to sing with all the voices of the mountains
we need to paint with all the colors of the wind
you can own the earth and still
all you'll own is earth until
you can paint with all the colors of the wind look for the bare necessities
the simple bare necessities
forget about your worries and your strife
i mean the bare necessities
old mother nature's recipes
that brings the bare necessities of life
wherever i wander, wherever i roam
i couldn't be fonder of my big home
the bees are buzzin' in the tree
to make some honey just for me
when you look under the rocks and plants
and take a glance at the fancy ants
then maybe try a few
you eat ants!?
haha, you better believe it
you're going to love the way they tickle
mowgli, watch out!
the bare necessities of life will come to you
they'll come to you!
look for the bare necessities
the simple bare necessities
forget about your worries and your strife
i mean the bare necessities
that's why a bear can rest at ease
with just the bare necessities of life
now when you pick a pawpaw
or a prickly pear
and you prick a raw paw
next time beware
don't pick the prickly pear by the paw
when you pick a pear
try to use the claw
but you don't need to use the claw
when you pick a pear of the big pawpaw
have i given you a clue?

and don't spend your time lookin' around
for something you want that can't be found
when you find out you can live without it
and go along not thinkin' about it
i'll tell you something true
the bare necessities of life will come to you
they'll come to you! i have often dreamed of a far-off place
where a great, warm welcome will be waiting for me
where the crowds will cheer when they see my face
and a voice keeps saying, this is where i'm meant to be
i will find my way, i can go the distance
i'll be there someday, if i can be strong
i know every mile will be worth my while
i would go most anywhere to feel like i belong

i am on my way, i can go the distance
i don't care how far, somehow i'll be strong
i know every mile will be worth my while
i would go most anywhere to find where i belong ariel, listen to me

under the sea i'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!
well, i've never seen a king of beasts with quite so little hair
i'm gonna be the main event, like no king was before
i'm brushing up on looking down, i'm working on my roar!
thus far, a rather... uninspiring thing
oh, i just can't wait to be king!
you've rather a long way to go, young master, if you think...
no one saying do this
now when i said that, i -
no one saying be there
what i meant was...
no one saying stop that
look, what you don't realize...
no one saying see here
now see here!
free to run around all day
well, that's definitely out
free to do it all my way!
i think it's time that you and i arranged a heart to heart
kings don't need advice from little hornbills for a start
if this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out!
out of service, out of africa - i wouldn't hang about... aagh!
this child is getting wildly out of wing
oh, i just can't wait to be king!
everybody look left
everybody look right
everywhere you look i'm standing in the spotlight!

let every creature go for broke and sing
let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
it's gonna be king simba's finest fling
oh, i just can't wait to be king!
oh, i just can't wait to be king!
oh i just can't wait... to be king! if there's a prize for rotten judgment
i guess i've already won that
no man is worth the aggravation
that's ancient history; been there, done that
who d'you think you're kiddin'?
he's the earth and heaven to ya
try to keep it hidden
honey, we can see right through ya oh nooo
girl, you can't conceal it
we know how you feel
and who you're thinking of
no chance, no way
i won't say it, no, no
you swoon, you sigh
why deny it? uh-oh
it's too cliché
i won't say i'm in love
i thought my heart had learned its lesson
it feels so good when you start out
my head is screaming "get a grip, girl
unless you're dying to cry your heart out"
ohhh...
you keep on denying
who you are and how you're feeling
baby, we're not buying
hon, we saw you hit the ceiling
oh, no
face it like a grown-up
when you gonna own up
that you got, got, got it bad?
no chance, no way
i won't say it, no, no
give up, give in
check the grin; you're in love
this scene won't play
i won't say i'm in love
you're doin' flips
read our lips: "you're in love"
you're way off base, i won't say it
get off my case, i won't say it
girl, don't be proud!
it's okay, you're in love
ohhh...
at least out loud
i won't say i'm in love
shoo do, shoo do, shoo do, shoo do
sha-la-la-la la la, ahh i never thought hyenas essential
they're crude and unspeakably plain
but maybe they've a glimmer of potential
if allied to my vision and brain
sung
i know that your powers of retention
are as wet as a warthog's backside
but–thick as you are–pay attention!
my words are a matter of pride
it's clear from your vacant expressions
the lights are not all on upstairs
but we're talking kings and successions
even you can't be caught unawares!
so prepare for the chance of a lifetime
be prepared for sensational news
a shining new era
is tiptoeing nearer
and where do we feature?
just listen to teacher
i know it sounds sordid
but you'll be rewarded
when at last i am given my dues
and injustice deliciously squared
be prepared!
yeah, be prepared! haha! we'll be prepared! for what?
for the death of the king!
why? is he sick?
no, fool, we're going to kill him. and simba too!
great idea! who needs a king?
no king, no king, la la la la la la!
idiots! there will be a king!
hey, but you said, uh...
i will be king! stick with me, and you'll never go hungry again!
yeah! alright! long live the king!
long live the king!
long live the king!
sung
it's great that we'll soon be connected
with a king who'll be all-time adored
of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
to take certain duties on board
the future is littered with prizes
and though i'm the main addressee
the point that i must emphasize is
you won't get a sniff without me!
so prepare for the coup of the century oooh!
be prepared for the murkiest scam oooh... la! la! la!
meticulous planning we'll have food!
tenacity spanning lots of food
decades of denial we repeat
is simply why i'll endless meat
be king undisputed aaah...
respected, saluted ...aaah...
and seen for the wonder i am ...aaah!
yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo

be prepared! you go girls...
we are the muses
goddesses of the arts
and proclaimers of heroes
heroes like hercules
honey you mean hunk-ules!
woohoo, i'd like to make some sweet music-
our story actually begins long before hercules
many eons ago
sung
back when the world was new
the planet earth was down on its luck
and everywhere gigantic brutes called titans ran amok
it was a nasty place!
there was a mess where ever you stepped
where chaos reigned and earthquakes and volcanoes never slept
woo! sing it girlfriend
but then along came zeus!
he hurled his thunderbolt
he zapped-
locked those suckers in a vault
they're trapped-
and on his own stopped chaos in its track
and that's the gospel truth
the guy was too type a to just relax!
and that's the world's first dish
yeah, baby
zeus tamed the globe while still in his youth
though honey it may seem impossible
that's the gospel truth!
on mt. olympus life was neat
and smooth as sweet vermouth
though honey it may seem impossible
that's the gospel truth i don't know if you can hear me
or if you're even there
i don't know if you would listen to a gypsy's prayer
yes, i know i'm just an outcast
i shouldn't speak to you
still i see your face and wonder
were you once an outcast too?
god help the outcasts
hungry from birth
show them the mercy
they don't find on earth
god help my people
we look to you still
god help the outcasts
or nobody will
i ask for wealth
i ask for fame
i ask for glory to shine on my name
i ask for love i can possess
i ask for god and his angels to bless me
i ask for nothing
i can get by
but i know so many
less lucky than i
please help my people
the poor and down-trod
i thought we all were children of god
god help the outcasts
children of god boys and girls of every age

i'd blame parents except he hasn't got 'em
gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
tell you all about it when i got the time
one jump ahead of the slowpokes
one skip ahead of my doom
next time gonna use a nom de plume
one jump ahead of the hitmen
one hit ahead of the flock
i think i'll take a stroll around the block
stop, thief!
vandal!
abu!
scandal!
let's not be too hasty
still i think he's rather tasty
gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
otherwise we'd get along
wrong!
one jump ahead of the hoofbeats
vandal!
one hop ahead of the hump
street rat!
one trick ahead of disaster
scoundrel!
they're quick, but i'm much faster
riffraff!
here goes
better throw my hand in
wish me happy landing
all i gotta do is jump! oh, i come from a land, from a faraway place
where the caravan camels roam
where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense
it's barbaric, but hey, it's home
when the wind's from the east
and the sun's from the west
and the sand in the glass is right
come on down, stop on by
hop a carpet and fly
to another arabian night
arabian nights, like arabian days
more often than not are hotter than hot
in a lot of good ways
arabian nights 'neath arabian moons
a fool off his guard could fall and fall hard
out there on the dunes olim
olim deus accelere
hoc saeculum splendidum
accelere fiat venire olim
morning in paris, the city awakes
to the bells of notre dame
the fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes
to the bells of notre dame
to the big bells as loud as the thunder
to the little bells soft as a psalm
and some say the soul of the city's
the toll of the bells
the bells of notre dame
speaking
listen, they're beautiful, no?
so many colours of sound, so many changing moods
because you know, they don't ring all by themselves
- they don't?
no, silly boy
up there, high, high in the dark bell tower
lives the mysterious bell ringer
who is this creature?
- who?
what is he?
- what?
how did he come to be there?
- how?
hush, and clopin will tell you
it is a tale, a tale of a man and a monster
sung
dark was the night when our tale was begun
on the docks near notre dame
shut it up, will you!
we'll be spotted!
hush, little one
four frightened gypsies slid silently under
the docks near notre dame
four guilders for safe passage into paris
but a trap had been laid for the gypsies
and they gazed up in fear and alarm
at a figure whose clutches
were iron as much as the bells
judge claude frollo!
the bells of notre dame
kyrie eleison lord have mercy
judge claude frollo longed
to purge the world
of vice and sin
kyrie eleison lord have mercy
and he saw corruption
ev'rywhere
except within
bring these gypsy vermin to the palace of justice
you there, what are you hiding?
stolen goods, no doubt. take them from her
she ran
dies irae, dies illa day of wrath, that day
solvet saeclum in favilla shall consume the world in ashes
teste david cum sibylla as prophesied by david and the sibyl
quantus tremor est futurus what trembling is to be
quando judex est venturus when the judge is come
sanctuary, please give us sanctuary!
a baby? a monster!
stop!
cried the archdeacon
this is an unholy deamon
i am sending it back to hell, where it belongs
see there the innocent blood you have spilt
on the steps of notre dame
i am guiltless. she ran, i pursued
now you would add this child's blood to your guilt
on the steps of notre dame
my conscience is clear!
you can lie to yourself and your minions
you can claim that you haven't a qualm
but you never can run from
nor hide what you've done from the eyes
the very eyes of notre dame
kyrie eleison lord have mercy
and for one time in his life
of power and control
kyrie eleison lord have mercy
frollo felt a twinge of fear
for his immortal soul
what must i do?
care for the child, and raise it as your own
what? i'm to be saddled with this misshapen...?
very well. let him live with you, in your church
live here? where?
anywhere
sung
just so he's kept locked away
where no one else can see
spoken
the bell tower, perhaps
and who knows, our lord works in mysterious ways
sung
even this foul creature may
yet prove one day to be
of use to me
and frollo gave the child a cruel name
a name that means "half-formed":
quasimodo
sung
now here is a riddle to guess if you can
sing the bells of notre dame
who is the monster and who is the man?
sing the bells, bells, bells, bells
bells, bells, bells, bells
bells of notre dame so long, farewell, to you, my friends
goodbye for now, until we meet again
i said so long, farewell, to you, my friends
goodbye for now, until we meet again
it's been great to play and sing together in the box
and now it's time to say goodbye
so long, farewell, to you, my friends
goodbye for now, until we meet again
goodbye for now, until we meet again everybody wants to be a cat
because a cat's the only cat
who knows where it's at
tell me
everybody's pickin' up on that feline beat
'cause everything else is obsolete
strictly high-button shoes!
a square with a horn makes you wish you weren't born
ever'time he plays
but with a square in the act
you can set music back
to the cave man days
cha-cha-ba-dum-bo-day
i've heard some corny birds who tried to sing
still a cat's the only cat who knows how to swing
who wants to dig a long-haired gig and stuff like that?
when everybody wants to be a cat
a square with a horn makes you wish you weren't born
ever'time he plays
oh, a-rinky-tinky-tinky
with a square in the act, you can set music back
to the cave man days
oh, a-rinky-tinky-tinky
yes
everybody wants to be a cat
because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's at
while playin' jazz you always has a welcome mat
'cause everybody digs a swingin' cat
if you want to turn me on
play your horn, don't spare the tone
and blow a little soul into the tune
let's take it to another key
modulate, and wait for me
i'll take a few ad-libs and pretty soon
the other cats will all commence
congregatin' on the fence
beneath the alley's only light
where every note is out of sight
everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! hallelujah!
everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! i'm telling you!
everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! yeah!
everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! mmm
everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! hallelujah!
everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat... i count the steps from one end of my island to the other
it's a hundred steps from where i sleep to the sea
and when i say i've learned all there is to know
well there's another little island lesson
gramma tala shows me
i know where i am from the scent of the breeze
the ascent of the climb
from the tangle of the trees
from the angle of the mountain
to the sand on our island shore
i've been here before
there's gotta be more
i know there's more, there's always more
someday i'll be out on the sea
and i'm gonna see more
yes, there's gotta be more
i know there's more, there's always—
moana, slow down
sorry! i'm always in somebody's way
they do the same thing every day
they work, they eat, they sleep, they pray
they tell me
"moana, calm down!"
that's all they ever seem to say
the other kids just dance and play
how can you play?
there's so much out there to explore
she stares at the sky, she stumbles down the beaches
she mumbles all the names that her gramma tala teaches
 
with one foot here and another in the distant past
 
she's growing up too fast
 
 
 
 
and i wanna soar
 
so much to explore
like i said before
there's gotta be more
i know there's more, there's always more
one day i'll be brave and sail on the wave
that leads me to more
there's gotta be more
i know there's more, there's always more
my father the chief, says "don't cross the reef"
but, oh, every turn i take, every trail i track
every path i make, every road leads back to the sea
i'm standing at the edge of the sea
as they all say
"moana, slow down
moana, dream small
moana, don't drown"
can you drown at the call of the sea?
'cause i can hear it calling me
aue, aue
a thousand years ago, we used to sail to distant islands
a thousand years ago, maui spoke to the sea
so maybe, just maybe, i was born to break the silence
i know my story could be extraordinary
i know my story doesn't end at the shore
there's gotta be more
i know there's more, there's always more
i'm gonna break through, and find something new
i'm gonna find more
there's gotta be more
i know there's more, there's always more
one day i'll decide to roll with the tide
and i'm gonna see
moana stand tall
i will cross the divide, i will ride
i will see what's on the other side
moana, stand proud
with the ocean as my guide, on the tide
i will go where no one's ever been before
there's always more a dream is a wish your heart makes
when you're fast asleep
in dreams you will lose your heartaches
whatever you wish for, you keep
have faith in your dreams and someday
your rainbow will come smiling through
no matter how your heart is grieving
if you keep on believing
the dream that you wish will come true
spoken
oh, that clock!  old killjoy.  i hear you, come on, get up you say!  time to start another day!  even he orders me around.  well, there's one thing - they can't order me to stop dreaming.  and perhaps, someday -
sung
the dreams that i wish will come true
vocalizing with mice
no matter how your heart is grieving
if you keep on believing
the dream that you wish will come true well, well, well, what have we here?
sandy claws, huh?
oh, i'm really scared
so you're the one everybody's talkin' about, ha, ha
you're jokin', you're jokin'
i can't believe my eyes
you're jokin' me, you gotta be
this can't be the right guy
he's ancient, he's ugly
i don't know which is worse
i might just split a seam now
if i don't die laughing first
when mr. oogie boogie says
there's trouble close at hand
you'd better pay attention now
cause i'm the boogie man
and if you aren't shakin'
then there's something very wrong
cause this may be the last time now
that you hear the boogie song, ohhh
ohhh
ohhh
ohhh
ohhh
ohhh, he's the oogie boogie man
well if i'm feelin' antsy
and there's nothin' much to do
i might just cook a special batch
of snake and spider stew
and don't ya know the one thing
that would make it work so nice?
a roly-poly sandy claws to add a little spice
ohhh
oh, yeah
ohhh
ohhh
ohhh
oh, yeah, i'm he's the oogie boogie man
release me now
or you must face the dire consequences
the children are expecting me
so please, come to your senses
you're jokin', you're jokin'
i can't believe my ears
would someone shut this fella up
i'm drownin' in my tears
it's funny, i'm laughing
you really are too much
and now, with your permission
i'm going to do my stuff
what are you going to do?
i'm gonna do the best i can
sung
oh, the sound of rollin' dice
to me is music in the air
cause i'm a gamblin' boogie man
although i don't play fair
it's much more fun, i must confess
when lives are on the line
not mine, of course, but yours, old boy
now that'd be just fine
release me fast or you will have to
answer for this heinous act
oh, brother, you're something
you put me in a spin
you aren't comprehending
the position that you're in
it's hopeless, you're finished
you haven't got a prayer
cause i'm mr. oogie boogie
and you ain't going nowhere now, i'm the king of the swingers, uh
the jungle vip
i've reached the top and had to stop
and that's what's botherin' me
i wanna be a man, man-cub
and stroll right into town
and be just like the other men
i'm tired of monkeyin' around
ooh, i wanna be like you
i wanna walk like you
talk like you, too
you'll see it's true
an ape like me
can learn to be
human too
now, don't try to kid me, man-cub
and don't get in a stew
what i desire is man's red fire
so i can be like you
now gimme the secret, man-cub
just clue me what to do
give me the power of man's red flower
and make my dreams come true
now i will ape your mannerisms
and we'll be a set of twins
no one will know
where man-cub ends and orangutan begins
and when i eat bananas
i won't peel them with my feet
'cause i'll become a man
man-cub and learn some etiquette
ooh, i wanna be like you
i wanna walk like you
talk like you, too
you'll see it's true
an ape like me
can learn to be
human too
can learn to be
human too
i wanna be like you
i wanna feel human, too once there was a princess -
was the princess you?
and she fell in love -
was it hard to do?
well, it was very easy. anyone could see that the prince was charming. the only one for me
was he strong and handsome?
was he big and tall?
there's nobody like him. anywhere at all
did he say he loved ya?
did he steal a kiss?
he was so romantic
i could not resist
someday my prince will come
someday we'll meet again
and away to his castle we'll go
to be happy forever i know
someday when spring is here
we'll find our love anew
and the birds will sing and wedding bells will ring
someday when my dreams come true what's this? what's this?
there's color everywhere
what's this?
there's white things in the air
what's this?
i can't believe my eyes
i must be dreaming
wake up, jack this isn't fair
what's this?
what's this? what's this?
there's something very wrong
what's this?
there's people singing songs
what's this?
the streets are lined with little creatures laughing
everybody seems so happy
have i possibly gone daffy?
what is this? what's this?
there's children throwing snowballs
instead of throwing heads
they're busy building toys
and absolutely no one's dead
there's frost on every window
oh, i can't believe my eyes
and in my bones i feel the warmth
that's coming from inside
oh, look
what's this?
they're hanging mistletoe, they kiss
why that looks so unique, inspired
they're gathering around to hear a story
roasting chestnuts on a fire
what's this? what's this?
in here they've got a little tree, how queer
and who would ever think?
and why?
they're covering it with tiny little things
they've got electric lights on strings
and there's a smile on everyone
so, now correct me if i'm wrong
this looks like fun, this looks like fun
oh, could it be i got my wish?
what's this?
oh my, what now?
the children are asleep
but look, there's nothing underneath
no ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them or ensnare them
only little cozy things, secure inside their dreamland
sigh
what's this?
the monsters are all missing
and the nightmares can't be found
and in their place there seems
to be good feeling all around
instead of screams, i swear
i can hear music in the air
the smell of cakes and pies
are absolutely everywhere
the sights, the sounds
they're everywhere and all around
i've never felt so good before
this empty place inside of me has been filling up
i simply cannot get enough
i want it oh, i want it oh
i want it for my own
i've got to know, i've got to know
what is this place that i have found?
what is this?
christmas town? hmm... wanna know a secret?
promise not to tell?
sung
we are standing by a wishing well
make a wish into the well
that's all you have to do
and if you hear it echoing
your wish will soon come true
i'm wishing
for the one i love
i'm wishing
to find me
today
to find me
today
i'm hoping
and i'm dreaming of
i'm hoping
the nice things
he'll say
the nice things
he'll say
vocalizing
i'm wishing
for the one i love
i'm wishing
to find me
today
to find me
today
now that i've found you
hear what i have to say
one song
i have but one song
one song
only for you
one heart
tenderly beating
ever entreating
constant and true
one love
that has possessed me
one love
thrilling me through
one song
my heart keeps singing
of one love
only for you i've got no strings to hold me down
to make me fret, or make me frown
i had strings, but now i'm free
there are no strings on me
hi-ho the merry-o
that's the only way to be
i want the world to know
nothing ever worries me
i've got no strings so i have fun
i'm not tied up to anyone
they've got strings, but you can see
there are no strings on me
you have no strings, your arms is free
to love me by the zeider zee
ya, ya, ya, if you would woo
i'd bust my strings for you
you got no strings, couci couca
your savoir faire is oo-la-la
i've got strings, but entre nous
i'd cut my strings for you
down where the volga flows
there's a russian rendez-vous
where me and ivan goes
but i'd rather go with you, hey
there are no strings on me the wonderful thing about tiggers
is tiggers are wonderful things
thier tops are made out of rubbers
their bottoms are made out fo springs
they're bouncy, trouncy, founcy, pouncy
fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!
but the most wonderful thing about tiggers
is
i'm the only one
the wonderful thing about tiggers
is tiggers are wonderful chaps
they're loaded with vim and with vigor
and love to leap in your laps
they're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy
fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!
but the most wonderful thing about tiggers
is
i'm the only one
tiggers are wonderful fellahs
tiggers are awfully sweet
everyone else is jealous
and that's why i repeat...
repeat first baby mine, don't you cry
baby mine, dry your eyes
rest your head close to my heart
never to part, baby of mine
little one when you play
don't you mind what you say
let those eyes sparkle and shine
never a tear, baby of mine
from your head to your toes
you're so sweet goodness knows
you are so precious to me
cute as can be, baby of mine what i love most about rivers is:
you can't step in the same river twice
the water's always changing, always flowing
but people, i guess, can't live like that
we all must pay a price
to be safe, we lose our chance of ever knowing
what's around the riverbend
waiting just around the riverbend
i look once more
just around the river bend
beyond the shore
where the gulls fly free
don't know what for
what i dream the day might send
just around the river bend
for me
coming for me
i feel it there beyond those trees
or right behind these waterfalls
can i ignore that sound of distant drumming
for a handsome sturdy husband
who builds handsome sturdy walls
and never dreams that something might be coming?
just around the river bend
just around the river bend
i look once more
just around the river bend
beyond the shore
somewhere past the sea
don't know what for...
why do all my dreams extend
just around the river bend?
just around the river bend...
should i choose the smoothest course
steady as the beating drum?
should i marry kocoum?
is all my dreaming at an end?
or do you still wait for me, dream giver
just around the river bend? as you go through life you'll see
there is so much that we
don't understand
and the only thing we know
is things don't always go
the way we planned
but you'll see every day
that we'll never turn away
when it seems all your dreams come undone
we will stand by your side
filled with hope and filled with pride
we are more than we are
we are one
family
family
we are one
family
family
we are one
if there's so much i must be
can i still just be me the way i am?
can i trust in my own heart?
or am i just one part of some big plan?
even those who are gone
are with us as we go on
your journey has only begun
tears of pain, tears of joy
one thing nothing can destroy
is our pride, deep inside
we are one
family
family
we are one
family
family
we are one
we are one, you and i
we are like the earth and sky
one family under the sun
all the wisdom to lead
all the courage that you need
you will find when you see
we are one!
family
family
we are one
family
family
we are one
chorus is repeated and ad-libbed until the end i sense there's something in the wind
that feels like tragedy's at hand
and though i'd like to stand by him
can't shake this feeling that i have
the worst is just around the bend
and does he notice
my feelings for him?
and will he see?
how much he means to me
i think it's not to be
what will become of my dear friend?
where will his actions lead us then?
all though i'd like to join the crowd
in their enthusiastic loud
try as i may
it doesn't last
and will we ever
end up together?
no i think not
it's never to become
for i am not the one i am a question to the world
not an answer to be heard
or a moment that's held in your arms
and what do you think you'd ever say?
i won't listen anyway
you don't know me
and i'll never be what you want me to be
and what do you think you'd understand?
i'm a boy—no, i'm a man
you can't take me and throw me away
and how can you learn what's never shown?
yeah, you stand here on your own
they don't know me 'cause i'm not here
and i want a moment to be real
wanna touch things i don't feel
wanna hold on and feel i belong
and how can the world want me to change?
they're the ones that stay the same
they don't know me 'cause i'm not here
and you see the things they never see
all you wanted, i could be
now you know me, and i'm not afraid
and i want to tell you who i am
can you help me be a man?
they can't break me, as long as i know who i am
and i want a moment to be real
wanna touch things i don't feel
wanna hold on, and feel i belong
and how can the world want me to change?
they're the ones that stay the same
they can't see me but i'm still here
they can't tell me who to be
'cause i'm not what they see
yeah, the world is still sleepin'
while i keep on dreamin' for me
and their words are just whispers
and lies that i'll never believe
and i want a moment to be real
want to touch things i don't feel
wanna hold on, and feel i belong
and how can you say i'll never change?
they're the ones that stay the same
i'm the one now 'cause i'm still here
i'm the one, 'cause i'm still here
i'm still here
i'm still here
i'm still here look out! look out!
pink elephants on parade
here they come!
hippity-hoppity
they're here and there
pink elephants everywhere
look out! look out!
they're walking around the bed, on their head
clippity-cloppity
arrayed in braid
pink elephants on parade
what'll i do? what'll i do?
what an unusual view!
i could stand the sight of worms
and look at microscopic germs
but technicolor pachyderms
is really too much for me
i am not the type to faint
when things are odd or things are quaint
but seeing things you know that ain't
can certainly give you an awful fright!
what a sight!
chase 'em away!
chase 'em away!
i'm afraid, need your aid
pink elephants on parade!
pink elephants!
pink elephants! "riffraff," "street rat"
i don't buy that
if only they'd look closer
would they see a poor boy?
no, siree
they'd find out
there's so much more to me...
spoken
someday, abu, things are gonna change. we'll be rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems at all.​​ kidnap mr. sandy claws...
i wanna do it!
let's draw straws!
jack said we should work together
three of a kind
birds of a feather
now and forever
wheeee
la, la, la, la, la
kidnap the sandy claws, lock him up real tight
throw away the key and then
turn off all the lights
first, we're going to set some bait
inside a nasty trap and wait
when he comes a-sniffing we will
snap the trap and close the gate
wait! i've got a better plan
to catch this big red lobster man
let's pop him in a boiling pot
and when he's done we'll butter him up
kidnap the sandy claws
throw him in a box
bury him for ninety years
then see if he talks
then mr. oogie boogie man
can take the whole thing over then
he'll be so pleased, i do declare
that he will cook him rare
wheeee!
oooooohooo! yum,yum,yum,yum
i say that we take a cannon
aim it at his door and then
knock three times and when he answers
sandy claws will be no more
you're so stupid, think now
if we blow him up into smithereens
we may lose some pieces
and then jack will beat us black and green
kidnap the sandy claws
tie him in a bag
throw him in the ocean
then see if he is sad
because mr. oogie boogie is the meanest guy around
if i were on his boogie list, i'd get out of town
he'll be so pleased by our success
that he'll reward us too, i'll bet
perhaps he'll make his special brew
of snake and spider stew
mmmmmm!
we're his little henchmen
and we take our job with pride
we do our best to please him
and stay on his good side
i wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
i'm not the dumb one
you're no fun
shut up!
make me
i've got something, listen up
this one is real good, you'll see
we'll send a present to his door
upon there'll be a note to read
now, in the box we'll wait and hide
until his curiousity...
entices him to look inside
and then we'll have him
one, two, three
kidnap the sandy claws, beat him with a stick
lock him up for ninety years, see what makes him tick
kidnap the sandy claws, chop him into bits
mr. oogie boogie is sure to get his kicks
kidnap the sandy claws, see what we will see
lock him in a cage and then throw away the key!!!
ha,ha,ha,ha!
sandy claws, hm... ? if there's one god you don't want to get steamed up
it's hades, 'cause he had an evil plan
he ran the underworld
but thought the dead were dull and uncouth
he was as mean as he was ruthless
and that's the gospel truth
he had a plan to shake things up
and that's the gospel truth i know you, i walked with you once upon a dream
i know you, the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
yet i know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem
but if i know you i know what you'll do
you'll love me at once the way you did once upon a dream
but if i know you, i know what you'll do
you'll love me at once
the way you did once—
—upon a dream
i know you, i walked with you once upon a dream
i know you, the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
and i know it's true, that visions are seldom all they seem
but if i know you i know what you'll do
you'll love me at once the way i did once upon a dream cruella de vil, cruella de vil
if she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
to see her is to take a sudden chill
cruella, cruella
she's like a spider waiting for the kill
look out for cruella de vil
at first you think cruella is a devil
but after time has worn away the shock
you come to realize you've seen her kind of eyes
watching you from underneath a rock!
this vampire bat, this inhuman beast
she ought to be locked up and never released
the world was such a wholesome place until
cruella, cruella de vil i seen a peanut stand, heard a rubber band
i seen a needle that winked its eye
but i be done seen 'bout ev'rything
when i see an elephant fly
what d'you say, boy?
i said when i see an elephant fly
i seen a front porch swing, heard a diamond ring
i seen a polka-dot railroad tie
but i be done seen 'bout ev'rything
when i see an elephant fly
{bridge}
i saw a clothes horse, he r'ar up and buck
and they tell me that a man made a vegetable truck
i didn't see that, i only heard
but just to be sociable, i'll take your word
i heard a fireside chat, i saw a baseball bat
and i just laughed till i thought i'd die
but i be done seen 'bout ev'rything
when i see an elephant fly
{bridge}
well i be done seen 'bout ev'rything
when i see an elephant fly
with the wind
when i see an elephant fly spoken

a whale of a tale or two
'bout the flappin' fish and the girls i've loved
on nights like this with the moon above
a whale of a tale and it's all true
i swear by my tattoo
there was mermaid minnie, met her down in madagascar
she would kiss me, any time that i would ask her
then one evening her flame of love blew out
blow me down and pick me up!
she swapped me for a trout
got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
a whale of a tale or two
'bout the flappin' fish and the girls i've loved
on nights like this with the moon above
a whale of a tale and it's all true
i swear by my tattoo
there was typhoon tessie, met her on the coast of java
when we kissed i bubbled up like molten lava
then she gave me the scare of my young life
blow me down and pick me up!
she was the captain's wife
got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
a whale of a tale or two
'bout the flappin' fish and the girls i've loved
on nights like this with the moon above
a whale of a tale and it's all true
i swear by my tattoo
then there was harpoon hannah
had a look that spelled out danger
my heart quivered when she whispered "i'm there, stranger"
bought her trinkets, that sailors can't afford sailors can't afford
and when i spend my last red cent
she tossed me overboard!
got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
a whale of a tale or two
'bout the flappin' fish and the girls i've loved
on nights like this with the moon above
a whale of a tale and it's all true
i swear by my tattoo deception
disgrace
evil as plain as the scar on his face
deception
an outrage!
disgrace
for shame!
he asked for trouble the moment he came
deception
an outrage!
he can't change his stripes
disgrace
for shame!
you know these outsider types
evil as plain as the scar on his face
see you later, agitator!
deception
an outrage!
just leave us alone!
disgrace
for shame!
traitor, go back with your own!
he asked for trouble the moment he came
see you later, agitator!
born in grief
raised in hate
helpless to defy his fate
let him run
let him live
but do not forget what we cannot forgive!
and he is not one of us
he has never been one of us
he is not part of us
not our kind
someone once lied to us
now we're not so blind
for we knew he would do what he's done
and we know that he'll never be one of us
he is not one of us
deception
disgrace
mmm-mmm-mmm, deception
disgrace
deception i came all this way, today
to give us a fresh start
but now that you're like "wow"
it's all like warm in my heart
i'm so glad you like it, sis
cause this is the real me
you have no idea
how great it feels to be free
we've been falling out for way too long
so let's forget who's right
and forget who's wrong
okay!
why don't you stay?
there's room for family in my court
cause life's too short
to always feel shut out and unloved
by the sister i long to know
life's too short
to never let you celebrate me
the true queen of the ice and snow
wohohooo
i never i never understood
but now i do
life's too short
to miss out on a sister like you
so you'll come back, then
back?
to thaw the fjord, it's frozen over, no one can get in or out?
oh
sooo...
oh!!!!
i don't believe you!
what?! i just assumed that you would have to...
that i'll shove on the gloves?
that's how your story ends?
it does! it's just like it was
except for we'll be best friends
so that's in your plan
to force me back in a cage
whoa, whoa! don't get upset
let's get back on the same page
gee'z,thanks for coming up to see the place
and showing off your mastery of tact and grace
run down the hill and spill my secrets
make a full report!
bye-bye!
wait!
cause life's too short
there it is!
the door you love to slam in my face!
you did well there for a spell
but now you're back in the same place
kick me out if you want, but i'm the only one who
is not one hundred percent convinced the prophecy's you!
you can think whatever you want cause i don't care
you're a fool who married a stranger!
that is so unfair
i swear
i'm through with taking your unshaking sisterly support!
support!
support!
ha! life's too short!
to let you treat the people down there
just as coldly as you always treated me
la la lalala laaaa
life's too short!
to listen to a reckless fool
who only ever sees the things she wants to see
you don't know me
you have no idea
what i've been through
because of you
life's too short to waste another minute
life's too short to even have you in it
life's too short
i've been so wrong about you
you?! you've been so wrong about everything
maybe you are the prophecy!
i am not the prophecy! the world is cruel
the world is wicked
it's i alone whom you can trust in this whole city
i am your only friend
i who keep you, teach you, feed you, dress you
i who look upon you without fear
how can i protect you, boy, unless you
always stay in here
away in here
spoken
remember what i taught you, quasimodo
sung
you are deformed
i am deformed
and you are ugly
and i am ugly
and these are crimes
for which the world
shows little pity
you do not comprehend
you are my one defender
out there they'll revile you
as a monster
i am a monster
out there they will hate
and scorn and jeer
only a monster
why invite their calumny
and consternation?
stay in here
be faithful to me
i'm faithful
grateful to me
i'm grateful
do as i say
obey
and stay
in here
i'll stay
in here
safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone
gazing at the people down below me
all my life i watch them as i hide up here alone
hungry for the histories they show me
all my life i memorize their faces
knowing them as they will never know me
all my life i wonder how it feels to pass a day
not above them
but part of them
and out there
living in the sun
give me one day out there
all i ask is one
to hold forever
out there
where they all live unaware
what i'd give
what i'd dare
just to live one day out there
out there among the millers and the weavers and their wives
through the roofs and gables i can see them
ev'ry day they shout and scold and go about their lives
heedless of the gift it is to be them
if i was in their skin
i'd treasure ev'ry instant
out there
strolling by the seine
taste a morning out there
like ordinary men
who freely walk about there
just one day and then
i swear i'll be content
with my share
won't resent
won't despair
old and bent
i won't care
i'll have spent
one day
out there now i'm the king of the swingers
oh, the jungle vip
i've reached the top and had to stop
and that's what botherin' me
i wanna be a man, mancub
and stroll right into town
and be just like the other men
i'm tired of monkeyin' around!
oh, oobee doo
i wanna be like you
i wanna walk like you
talk like you, too
you'll see it's true
an ape like me
can learn to be humen too
gee, cousin louie
you're doin' real good
now here's your part of the deal, cuz
lay the secret on me of man's red fire
but i don't know how to make fire
now don't try to kid me, mancub
i made a deal with you
what i desire is man's red fire
to make my dream come true
give me the secret, mancub
clue me what to do
give me the power of man's red flower
so i can be like you
you!
i wanna be like you
i wanna talk like you
walk like you, too
you'll see it's true
someone like me
can learn to be
like someone like me
can learn to be
like someone like you
can learn to be
like someone like me! alice in wonderland
how do you get to wonderland
over the hill or underland
or just behind the tree
when clouds go rolling by
they roll away and leave the sky
where is the land beyond the eye
that people cannot see
where can it be
where do stars go
where is the crescent moon
they must be somewhere in the sunny afternoon
alice in wonderland
where is the path to wonderland
over the hill or here or there
i wonder where young herc was mortal now
but since he did not drink the last drop
he still retained his godlike strength
so thank his lucky star
but zeus and hera wept
because their son could never come home
they'd have to watch their precious baby
grow up from afar
though hades' horrid plan
was hatched before herc cut his first tooth
the boy grew stronger every day
and that's the gospel truth
the gospel truth hike! ugh! hike! ugh! hike! ugh! hike!
we work all day, we work all night
we never learned to read or write
we're happy-hearted roustabouts
hike! ugh! hike! ugh! hike! ugh! hike!
when other folks have gone to bed
we slave until we're almost dead
we're happy-hearted roustabouts
hike! ugh! hike! ugh! hike! ugh! hike!
we don't know when we get our pay
and when we do, we throw our pay away
we get our pay when children say
with happy hearts, "it's circus day today"
muscles achin'
back near breaking
eggs and bacon what we need yes, sir!
boss man houndin'
keep on poundin'
for your bed and feed

but must keep awake
hep! heave! hep! heave! hep! heave!

poundin'! poundin'! poundin'! poundin'!
oh she showed me day after day
how to find my way
she taught me how to rely
on the wind and sky
she named me after the sea
she believed in me
i know we use to be bold
from the tales she told
i know she left me prepared
from the things she shared
there was more she wanted to see
staring at the barrier together on the shore
we practice all the names of everyone who came before me
voyagers, warriors, ancestors in our line
their blood runs in mine
she always knew more
she hungered for more
she taught me more
and somehow i know
she'd want me to go
to navigate, you have to keep your island in your mind
you'll know what lies ahead if you remember what's behind you
want to find the answers to the questions that you still don't know
you just have to go, find more
i wanna know more
there's always more
how can i stay
she taught me the way
every turn i take
every trail i track
every path i make
every road leads back to the sea
i am sailing to the edge of the sea
and it calls me—
moana go now
moana don't stall
don't worry 'bout how
just answer the call of the sea
there's nothing there holding me
if i had time
i'd say goodbye
i will cross the divide, i will ride
i will see what's on the other side
with the ocean as my guide, on the tide
i will go where no one's ever been before
there's always more just whistle while you work
and cheerfully together we can tidy up the place
so hum a merry tune
it won't take long when there's a song to help you set the pace
and as you sweep the room
imagine that the broom
is someone that you love
and soon you'll find you're dancing to the tune
when hearts are high the time will fly
so whistle while you work
so whistle while you work i'm just a little black rain cloud
hovering under the honey tree
i'm only a little black rain cloud
pay no attention to little me
everyone knows that a rain cloud
never eats honey, no, not a nip
i'm just floating around over the ground
wondering where i will drip put your faith in what you most believe in
two worlds, one family
trust your heart, let fate decide
to guide these lives we see
a paradise untouched by man
within this world blessed with love
a simple
life, they live in peace
softly tread the sand below your feet now
two worlds, one family
trust your heart, let fate decide
to guide these
lives we see
beneath the shelter of the trees
only love can enter here
a simple life, they live in peace
raise your head up, lift high the load
take strength from those that need you
build high the walls, build strong the beams
a new life is waiting but danger's no stranger here
no words describe a mother's tears
no words can heal a broken heart
a dream is gone but where there's hope
somewhere, something is calling for you
two worlds, one family
trust your heart, let fate decide
to guide these lives we see i will beat the odds, i can go the distance
i will face the world, fearless, proud, and strong
i will please the gods, i can go the distance
till i find my hero's welcome right where i belong there are few who deny at what i do i am the best
for my talents are renowned far and wide
when it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
i excel without ever even trying
with the slightest little effort of my ghost-like charms
i have seen grown men give out a shriek
with the wave of my hand and a well-placed moan
i have swept the very bravest off their feet
yet year after year it's the same routine
and i grow so weary of the sound of screams
and i jack the pumpkin king!
have grown so tired of the same old thing...
oh somewhere deep inside of these bones
an emptiness began to grow
there's something out there far from my home
a longing that i've never known
i'm a master of fright and a demon of light
and i'll scare you right out of your pants
to a guy in kentucky i'm mister unlucky
and i'm known throughout england and france
and since i am dead i can take off my head
to recite shakespearean quotations
no animal nor man can scream like i can
with the fury of my recitations
but who here would ever understand
that the pumpkin king with the skeleton grin
would tire of his crown- if they only understood
he would give it all up if he only could
oh there's an empty place in my bones
that calls out for something unknown
the fame and praise come year after year
does nothing for these empty tears... in a perfect world
one we've never known
we would never need
to face the world alone
they can have the world
we'll create our own
i may not be brave or strong or smart
but somewhere in my secret heart
i know love will find a way
anywhere i go, i'm home
if you are there beside me
like dark, turning into day
somehow we'll come through
now that i've found you
love will find a way
i was so afraid, now i realize
love is never wrong
and so it never dies
there's a perfect world
shining in your eyes
and if only they could feel it too
the happiness i feel with you
they'd know love will find a way
anywhere we go, we're home
if we are there together
like dark, turning into day
somehow we'll come through
now that i've found you
love will find a way
i know love will find a way if i never knew you
if i never felt this love
i would have no inkling of
how precious life can be
and if i never held you
i would never have a clue
how at last i'd find in you
the missing part of me
in this world so full of fear
full of rage and lies
i can see the truth so clear
in your eyes, so dry your eyes
and i'm so grateful to you
i'd have lived my whole life through
lost forever
if i never knew you
if i never knew you
i'd be safe but half as real
never knowing i could feel
a love so strong and true
i'm so grateful to you
i'd have lived my whole life through
lost forever
if i never knew you
i thought our love would be so beautiful
somehow we made the whole world bright
i never knew that fear and hate could be so strong
all they'd leave us where these whispers in the night
but still my heart is singing, we were right
oh, if i never knew you
there's no moment i regret
if i never knew this love
since the moment that we met
i would have no inkling of
if our time has gone too fast
how precious life can be
i've lived at last, yeah yeah
i thought our love would be so beautiful
somehow we'd make the whole world bright
i thought our love would be so beautiful
we'd turn the darkness into light
and still my heart is singing, we were right
we were right
and if i never knew you
i'd have lived my whole life through
empty as the sky, never knowing why
lost forever, if i never knew you, yeah oh, this is the night
it's a beautiful night
and they call it bella notte
look at the skies
they have stars in their eyes
on this lovely bella notte
side by side with your loved one
you'll find an enchantment here
the night will weave its magic spell
when the one you love is near
so this is the night
and the heavens are right
on this lovely bella notte
this is the night
it's a beautiful night
and we call it bella notte
look at the skies

and the heavens are right
on this lovely bella notte robin hood and little john, walking through the forest
laughing back and forth at what the other’n has to say
reminiscing this and that and having such a good time
oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day
never ever thinking there was danger in the water
they were drinking, they just guzzled it down
never dreaming that a scheming sheriff and his posse
was a-watching them and gathering around
robin hood and little john, running through the forest
jumping fences, dodging trees and trying to get away
contemplating nothing but escape and finally making it
oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day
oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day deep in the hundred acre wood

every truly cultured music student knows
you must learn your scales and your arpeggios
bring the music ringing from your chest
and not your nose
while you sing your scales and your arpeggios
if you're faithful to your daily practicing
you will find your progress is encouraging
do mi so me do mi so me fa la so it goes
when you do your scales and your arpeggios
do mi so do
do mi so do do so mi do
do mi so do do so mi do
though at first it seems as though it doesn't show
like a tree ability will bloom and grow
if you're smart you'll learn by heart what every artist knows

and your arpeggios! born on a mountain top in tennessee
greenest state in the land of the free
raised in the woods so he knew ev'ry tree
kilt him a b'ar when he was only three
davy, davy crockett, king of the wild frontier!
in eighteen thirteen the creeks uprose
addin' redskin arrows to the country's woes
now, injun fightin' is somethin' he knows
so he shoulders his rifle an' off he goes
davy, davy crockett, the man who don't know fear!
off through the woods he's a marchin' along
makin' up yarns an' a singin' a song
itchin' fer fightin' an' rightin' a wrong
he's ringy as a b'ar an' twict as strong
davy, davy crockett, the buckskin buccaneer!
andy jackson is our gen'ral's name
his reg'lar soldiers we'll put to shame
them redskin varmints us volunteers'll tame
'cause we got the guns with the sure-fire aim
davy, davy crockett, the champion of us all!~
headed back to war from the ol' home place
but red stick was leadin' a merry chase
fightin' an' burnin' at a devil's pace
south to the swamps on the florida trace
davy, davy crockett, trackin' the redskins down!
fought single-handed through the injun war
till the creeks was whipped an' peace was in store
an' while he was handlin' this risky chore
made hisself a legend for evermore
davy, davy crockett, king of the wild frontier!
he give his word an' he give his hand
that his injun friends could keep their land
an' the rest of his life he took the stand
that justice was due every redskin band
davy, davy crockett, holdin' his promise dear!
home fer the winter with his family
happy as squirrels in the ol' gum tree
bein' the father he wanted to be
close to his boys as the pod an' the pea
davy, davy crockett, holdin' his young'uns dear!
but the ice went out an' the warm winds came
an' the meltin' snow showed tracks of game
an' the flowers of spring filled the woods with flame
an' all of a sudden life got too tame
davy, davy crockett, headin' on west again!
off through the woods we're ridin' along
makin' up yarns an' singin' a song
he's ringy as a b'ar an' twict as strong
an' knows he's right 'cause he ain' often wrong
davy, davy crockett, the man who don't know fear!
lookin' fer a place where the air smells clean
where the trees is tall an' the grass is green
where the fish is fat in an untouched stream
an' the teemin' woods is a hunter's dream
davy, davy crockett, lookin' fer paradise!
now he's lost his love an' his grief was gall
in his heart he wanted to leave it all
an' lose himself in the forests tall
but he answered instead his country's call
davy, davy crockett, beginnin' his campaign!
needin' his help they didn't vote blind
they put in davy 'cause he was their kind
sent up to nashville the best they could find
a fightin' spirit an' a thinkin' mind
davy, davy crockett, choice of the whole frontier!
the votes were counted an' he won hands down
so they sent him off to washin'ton town
with his best dress suit still his buckskins brown
a livin' legend of growin' renown
davy, davy crockett, the canebrake congressman!
he went off to congress an' served a spell
fixin' up the govern'ments an' laws as well
took over washin'ton so we heered tell
an' patched up the crack in the liberty bell
davy, davy crockett, seein' his duty clear!
him an' his jokes travelled all through the land
an' his speeches made him friends to beat the band
his politickin' was their favorite brand
an' everyone wanted to shake his hand
davy, davy crockett, helpin' his legend grow!
he knew when he spoke he sounded the knell
of his hopes for white house an' fame as well
but he spoke out strong so hist'ry books tell
an' patched up the crack in the liberty bell
davy, davy crockett, seein' his duty clear!
when he come home his politickin' done
the western march had just begun
so he packed his gear an' his trusty gun
an' lit out grinnin' to follow the sun
davy, davy crockett, leadin' the pioneer!
he heard of houston an' austin so
to the texas plains he jest had to go
where freedom was fightin' another foe
an' they needed him at the alamo
davy, davy crockett, the man who don't know fear!
his land is biggest an' his land is best
from grassy plains to the mountain crest
he's ahead of us all meetin' the test
followin' his legend into the west
davy, davy crockett, king of the wild frontier! tamatoa hasn't always been this glam
i was a drab little crab once
now i know i can be happy as a clam
because i'm beautiful, baby
oh, did your daddy say to listen to your heart?
be who you are on the inside?
i need three words to tear his argument apart
your daddy lied
i'd rather be shiny
like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck
scrub the deck and make it look shiny
i will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck
just a sec, don't you know?
fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
they chase anything that glitters, beginners
here they come, come, come
to the brightest thing that glitters
my dinners
you're far too hasty hasty
you look tasty tasty
wow, little maui's having trouble with his look
you little semi-demi-mini-god
ouch! what a terrible performance
get the hook! get it?
you don't swing it like you used to, man
yet i have to give you credit for my start
and your tattoos on the outside
for just like you i made myself a work of art
i'll never hide, i can't
i'm too shiny
i'm the sunrise on the surface of the sea
look at me, you see i'm so shiny
the monsters see my weaponry and flee
c'est la vie, don't you know
i will shine, shine, shine
like a rainbow after showers
your powers will be mine, mine, mine
they'll be mourning you for hours
bring flowers
call me selfish selfish
call me shellfish shellfish
far from the gods who abandoned you
chasing the love of these humans
who made you feel wanted
it's never enough
love yourself, get your armor up
they can see, your heart is a vacancy
so why not be shiny
watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough
strut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny
send your armies but they'll never be enough
my shell's too tough, maui man
you could try, try, try
but i hate negotiations, prostrations
you will die, die, die
never test a big crustacean's impatience
unless you have something shiny
unless you have something shiny 1, 2, 3, 4

a baby cry?
where we finding baby, there are milk nearby
if we look in baby buggy there could be
plenty milk for you and also some for me so, ya wanna be a hero, kid? well, whoop de do
i have been around the block before with blockheads just like you
each and everyone, a disappointment
pain for which there ain't no ointment
so much fo excuses though a kid of zeus
is asking me to jump into the fray
my answer is two words -
o - kay
you win
oh gods
oy vay...
i'd given up hope that someone would come along
a fellow who'd ring the bell for once, not the gong
the kind who wins trophies, won't settle for low fees
at least semi-pro fees but no - i get the green horn
i've been out to pasture pal, my ambition gone
content to spend lazy days and to graze my lawn
but you need an advisor, a satyr but wiser
a good merchandiser and woah - there goes my ulcer!
i'm down to one last hope and i hope it's you
though kid, you're not exactly a dream come true
i've trained enough turkeys who never came through
you're my one last hope, so you'll have to do!
demigods have faced the odds and ended up a mockery
don't believe the stories that you read on all the crockery
to be a true hero kid is a dying art
like painting a masterpiece, it's a work of heart
it takes more than sinew, comes down to what's in you
you have to continue to grow
now that's more like it!
i'm down to one last shot
and my last high note
before that blasted underworld gets my goat
my dreams are on you, kid -
go make them come true!
climb that uphill slope, keep pushing that envelope
you're my one last hope and kid
it's up to you!

x 2 spoken
when hinges creak in doorless chambers
and strange and frightening sounds
echo through the halls
whenever candlelights flicker
where the air is deathly still
that is the time when ghosts are present
practicing their ghoulish delight
organ solo
when the crypt doors creak
and the tombstones quake
spooks come out for a swinging wake
happy haunts materialize
and begin to vocalize
grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize
now don't close your eyes
and don't try to hide
or a silly spook may sit by your side
shrouded in a daft disguise
they pretend to terrorize
grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize
as the moon climbs high o'er the dead oak tree
spooks arrive for the midnight spree
creepy creeps with eerie eyes
start to shriek and harmonize
grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize
when you hear the knell of a requiem bell
weird glows gleam where spirits dwell
restless bones etherialize
rise as spooks of every size

up above the world you fly
like a tea tray in the sky
a very merry unbirthday to you! abandoned by his parents and raised by the gods
who could see he was destined for greatness
though he was no bigger than you or me as a baby
he was a demigod!
wow!
with lightning speed!
and he gave our people all the things we need, yes indeed
we were crawling on the ground
he looked around and said, "you need a little more space!"
and he raised the sky
so we could walk, so we could fly!
we were crawling on the ground
he looked around and said, "you need a little more space!"
and he raised the sky
so we could walk, so we could fly!
we were walking in the dark
'til maui found a spark, down in the underworld
he climbed up higher and higher
bringing the gift of fire
we were walking in the dark
'til maui found a spark, down in the underworld
he climbed up higher and higher
bringing the gift of fire
when maui was around, we were unstoppable
we shattered all the rules, ran free
we tore down every wall
and we answered the call of the sea
we used to sail with gods, we were unstoppable
to islands, we could go explore
with every breaking dawn
our adventures would go on beyond the shore
maui taught us how to see the waves
maui taught us how the sea behaves
maui taught us how to see the skies
how to see the way the seagull flies
maui taught us how the stars can guide us
the secrets that the ocean can provide us
how to see our way through wind and rain
and know the way back home is there inside us
we ran the world, we were unstoppable
we learned to sail the seas alone
with every escapade
we were brave and unafraid of the unknown
we gathered up our strength, we were unstoppable
we chased the long horizon line
we faced tremendous odds
but we rumbled with the gods, and we were fine
hey, master of disguise
he could assume any form, any shape or size
he used to fight fantastic monsters
take 'em by surprise
master of disguise
he could assume any form, any shape or size
he used to fight fantastic monsters
take 'em by surprise
until the fateful night
the only time he ever lost a fight
a thousand years ago
against a demon named...
te-pō...
te-pō...
te-pō...
te-pō...
te-pō was a brutal land spirit
legend says, she devoured maui whole, and with the disappearance of maui came the end of our voyages
the villainous te-pō did the impossible
and maui, just like that, was gone
our demigod, our friend, fought for us until the end
and he lives on
for a thousand years, we have made motunui our home
but there can be a new maui, a new generation!
sung
i am moana, i am unstoppable
i know how big the world can be
if maui lives in you
we can sail across the blue unending sea
we're ready for what's next, we are unstoppable
we want to see the world beyond the shore
for maui years ago
taught us everything we know, so let's explore!
we want more
we want more
we want more!
unstoppable! spoken
just gather round and i'll elucidate
on what goes on outside when it gets late
along about midnight, the ghosts and banshees
get together for their nightly jamboree
there's things with horns and saucer eyes
some with fangs about this size
some are fat
and some are thin
and some don't even wear their skin
i'm telling ya, brother. it's a frightful sight
to see what goes on halloween night
sung
when the spooks have a midnight jamboree
they break it up with fiendish glee
ghosts are bad, but the one that's cursed
is the headless horseman, he's the worst
that's right, he's a fright
on halloween night
when he goes a-joggin' 'cross the land
holdin' his noggin in his hand
demons take one look and groan
and hit the road for parts unknown
beware, take care, he rides alone
and there's no spook like a spook who's spurned
they don't like him, and he's really burned
he swears to the longest day he's dead
he'll show them that he can get a head
they say he's tired of his flamin' top
he's got a yen to make a swap
so he rides one night each year
to find a head in the hollow here
now he likes them little, he likes them big
part in the middle, or a wig
black or white or even red
the headless horseman needs a head
with a hip-hip and a clippity-clop
he's out lookin' for a top to chop
so don't stop to figure out a plan
you can't reason with a headless man
now if you doubt this tale is so
i met that spook just a year ago
now i didn't stop for a second look
but made for the bridge that spans the brook
for once you cross that bridge, my friends
the ghost is through, his power ends
so when you're riding home tonight
make for the bridge with all your might
he'll be down in the hollow there
he needs your head, look out, beware
with a hip-hip and a clippity-clop
he's out looking for a head to swap
so don't try to figure out a plan
you can't reason with a headless man what a dog
what a dog
he's a tramp, but they love him
breaks a new heart every day
he's a tramp, they adore him
and i only hope he'll stay that way
he's a tramp, he's a scoundrel
he's a rounder, he's a cad
he's a tramp, but i love him
yes, even i have got it pretty bad
you can never tell when he'll show up
he gives you plenty of trouble
i guess he's just a no-count pup
but i wish that he were double
he's a tramp, he's a rover
and there's nothing more to say
if he's a tramp, he's a good one
and i wish that i could travel his way
wish that i could travel his way
wish that i could travel his way cats and rabbits
would reside in fancy little houses
and be dressed in shoes and hats and trousers
in a world of my own
all the flowers
would have very extra special powers
they would sit and talk to me for hours
when i'm lonely in a world of my own
there'd be new birds
lots of nice and friendly howdy-do birds
everyone would have a dozen bluebirds
within that world of my own
i could listen to a babbling brook
and hear a song that i could understand
i keep wishing it could be that way
because my world would be a wonderland r-e-s-c-u-e

you're a princess just like me
bet you're thinking maybe
it's a pretty cool thing to be
but soon you'll see that everyone expects a lot from you
they say that there a princess should and shouldn't do
but you and me
we, we know better
1, 2, 3 together, clap together, snap together
you and me together, knees together, freeze together
up or down together, princess crowned together
always be together, you and me
they say a princess is full of charm and grace
they say she always knows her place
they say a princess wears pink and frilly clothes
they say she never laughs, and snorts milk out her nose
they say she's calm, they say she's kind
they say she never speaks her mind
or freezes nanny's big behind!
but you and me
we, we know better
nanny: you girls are in so much trouble, when i tell your father...
anna: how come you can do that and i can't?
elsa: i don't know. i wish you could though.
they say a princess is super duper sweet
she doesn't fight, she doesn't sweat, and you never see her eat
they say a princess doesn't climb and scrape her knee
they say a princess wouldn't freeze her tutor's tea
they say she poised, they say she's fair
she never mentions underwear!
or longs to see the world out there...
but you and me
we...
have big ideas of our own
for the distant someday when we're grown
when i'm queen and i'm your right hand
you'll get to travel throughout the land!
i'll them of my sister, and the magic things she can do
we'll take care of our people
and they will love me and you
no one can tell us what a princess should be
as long as we're together, you and me... drip, drip, drop

and the virginia company
for the new world is like heaven
and we'll all be rich and free
or so we have been told
by the virginia company
so we have been told
by the virginia company

for glory, god and gold
and the virginia company
on the beaches of virginny
there's diamonds like debris
there's silver rivers flow
and gold you pick right off a tree
with a nugget for my winnie
and another one for me
and all the rest'll go
to the virginia company
it's glory, god and gold
and the virginia company so many times out here
i've watched a happy pair
of lovers walking in the night
they had a kind of glow around them
it almost looked like heaven's light
i knew i'd never know
that warm and loving glow
though i might wish with all my might
no face as hideous as my face
was ever meant for heaven's light
but suddenly an angel has smiled at me
and kissed my cheek without a trace of fright
i dare to dream that she
might even care for me
and as i ring these bells tonight
my cold dark tower seems so bright
i swear it must be heaven's light there is a world where hope
and dreams can last for all time
a wondrous place to go
you'll know it when your heart finds
hearing our song as old as rhyme
hold my hand we're going to fly
what a magic ride
and just a kiss away
if you can dream
the wish we're making on a star
is coming true
the colors of the wind will lead
my heart right back to you
'cause if you can dream
reflections in a diamond sky
come shining on through
romance will always be so new
and love will save the day
if you can dream
someday my prince will come
it's certain as the sunrise
one day the slipper fits
then you see the love in his eyes
it's a tale as old as time
there's no mountain we can't climb
when you're finally mine
and just a kiss away
if you can dream
the wish we're making on a star
is coming true
the colors of the wind will lead
my heart right back to you
'cause if you can dream
reflections in a diamond sky
come shining on through
romance will always be so new
and love will save the day
if you can dream
so the story goes
never die the rose
there's a whole new world
waiting there for us
waiting just for us
if you can dream
the wish we're making on a star
is coming true
the colors of the wind will lead
my heart right back to you
'cause if you can dream
reflections in a diamond sky
come shining on through

and love will save the day

sleep, my little kovu
let your dreams take wing
one day when you're big and strong
you will be a king!
i've been exiled, persecuted
left alone with no defense
when i think of what that brute did
i get a little tense
but i dream a dream so pretty
that i don't feel so depressed
'cause it soothes my inner kitty
and it helps me get some rest
the sound of simba's dying gasp
his daughter squealing in my grasp
his lionesses' mournful cry
that's my lullaby!
now the past i've tried forgetting
and my foes i could forgive
trouble is, i know it's petty
but i hate to let them live
so you found yourself somebody
who'll chase simba up a tree
oh, the battle may be bloody
but that kind of works for me
the melody of angry growls
a counterpoint of painful howls
a symphony of death, oh my!
that's my lullaby!
scar is gone, but zira's still around
to love this little lad
'til he learns to be a killer
with a lust for being bad!
sleep, ya little termite!
uh—i mean, precious little thing
one day when you're big and strong
you will be a king
the pounding of the drums of war!
the thrill of kovu's mighty roar!
the joy of vengeance!
testify!
i can hear the cheering
kovu! what a guy!
payback time is nearing
and then our flag will fly
against a blood-red sky
that's my lullaby! the second star to the right
shines in the night for you
to tell you that the dreams you plan
really can come true

shines with a light that's rare
and if it's never land you need
it's light will lead you there
twinkle, twinkle little star
so i'll know where you are
gleaming in the skies above
lead me to the land we dream of
and when our journey is through
each time we say "goodnight"
we'll thank the little star that shines
the second from the right ah, salaam and good evening to you, my dear friend.

in the faraway land of ancient greece
there was a golden age of powerful gods and extraordinary heroes
and the greatest and strongest of all these heroes
was the mighty hercules
but what is the measure of a true hero?
now that is where our story-
would you listen to him?
he's making our story sound like some greek tragedy
lighten up dude!
we'll take it from here darling be brave, little one
make a wish for each sad little tear
hold your head up, though no one is near
someone's waiting for you
don't cry, little one
there'll be a smile where a frown used to be
you'll be part of the love that you see
someone's waiting for you
always keep a little prayer in your pocket
and you're sure to see the light
soon there'll be joy and happiness
and your little world will be bright
have faith, little one
'til your hopes and your wishes come true
you must try to be brave, little one
someone's waiting to love you the walrus and the carpenter
or, the story of the curious oysters
the sun was shining on the sea
shining with all his might
he did his very best to make
the billows smooth and bright
and this was odd because it was
the middle of the night
the walrus and the carpenter
were walking close at hand
the beach was wide
from side to side
but much too full of sand
"mr. walrus," said the carpenter
"my brain begins to perk
we'll sweep this clear in 'alf a year
if you don't mind the work"
"work?! the time has come," the walrus said
"to talk of other things
of shoes and ships and sealing wax
of cabbages and kings
and why the sea is boiling hot
and whether pigs have wings
calloo-callay
no work today!
we're cabbages and kings"
oh, uh, oysters, come and walk with us
the day is warm and bright
a pleasant walk
a pleasant talk
would be a sheer delight
yes, and should we get hungry on the way
we'll stop and, uh, have a bite?
but mother oyster winked her eye
and shook her hairy head
she knew too well
this was no time to leave her oyster bed
"the sea is nice
take my advice
and stay right here," mum said
yes, yes, of course, of course, but, uh, ha, ha
the time has come, my little friends
to talk of other things
of shoes and ships and sealing wax
of cabbages and kings
and why the sea is boiling hot
and whether pigs have wings, ha ha
callo-callay
come, run away
with cabbages and kings!
well, now, uh, let me see
ah, a loaf of bread is
what we chiefly need!
listen, how 'bout some pepper and salt and vinegar, eh?
well, yes, yes, splendid idea, ha ha!
very good, indeed
now, if your ready, oysters, dear
we can begin the feed
feed?!
oh, yes, the time has come, my little friends
to talk of food and things
of peppercorns and mustard seeds
and other seasonings!
we'll mix 'em all together
in a sauce that's fit for kings
calloo-callay
we'll eat today
like cabbages and kings!
i, uh, weep for you. i hic, oh excuse me
i deeply sympathise
for i've enjoyed your company, oh much more
than you realize
little oysters? little oysters?
but answer, there came none
and this was scarcely odd because
they'd been eaten
every one!
with cabbages and kings!
the end! jiminy and pinocchio whistling
that's it! come on now! lets sing it!
sung
when you get in trouble
and you don't know right from wrong
give a little whistle, give a little whistle
when you meet temptation
and the urge is very strong
give a little whistle, give a little whistle
not just a little squeak, pucker up and blow
and if your whistle is weak, yell
jiminy cricket?
right!
sung
take the straight and narrow path
and if you start to slide
give a little whistle, give a little whistle
and always let your conscience be your guide
take the strait and narrow path
and if you start to slide
give a little whistle yoo-hoo
give a little whistle yoo-hoo!
and always let your conscience be your guide
and always let your conscience be your guide! what have i done? what have i done?
how could i be so blind?
all is lost, where was i?
spoiled all, spoiled all
everything's gone all wrong
what have i done? what have i done?
find a deep cave to hide in
in a million years, they'll find me
only dust and a plaque that reads
'here lies poor old jack'
but i never intended all this madness, never
and nobody really understood, well, how could they?
that all i ever wanted was to bring them something great
why does nothing ever turn out like it should?
well, what the heck? i went and did my best
and my god, i really tasted something swell, that's right
and for a moment, why, i even touched the sky
and at least i left some stories they can tell, i did

sandy claws, hmm there's a place where the crazy moon
makes the monkeys sing ah-ah-ah!
and the baboons swoon
and the sultry scent of the lotus bloom
will carry you away
while the hippos swing from the jungle vines
and the rhino rumba in a conga line
all the pink flamingos are intertwined
as the stars come out to play!
uh!
in upendi
where the passion fruit grows sweet
and it's so divine so divine
that you'll lose your mind lose your mind
as it sweeps you off your feet
in upendi
without a worry or a care
it just takes two
to make it true
your heart will lead you there
in upendi, in upendi
you better watch your step
'cause the path is steep
you better hold your breath
'cause the water's deep
it's a long way down off of lover's leap
but falling's half the fun!
in upendi
where the passion fruit grows sweet
and it's so divine
that you'll lose your mind lose your mind
as it sweeps you off your feet sweeps you off your feet
in upendi
without a worry or a care
it just takes two
to make it true
your heart will take you there
you can beat the bush like there's no tomorrow
from tanganyika to kilimanjaro!
but you'll find upendi wherever you are
oh, underneath the sun sun!
in upendi
where the passion fruit grows sweet
and it's so divine
that you'll lose your mind lose your mind

on a starry, starry night
and the wind is deadly still

oh! we're on our way
the voyage starts with open hearts
we set a course and head for parts unknown
a new adventure to learn about new cultures
and leave behind the world we've always known
come join us on our journey!
we're on our way
we're on our way
together we can change the world and find a brighter day
let's celebrate
let's dance and play
to the rhythm of the world we find today
we're on our way
we're on our way
come join us on our journey!
we're on our way
we're on our way
a new adventure calls to us - let it begin today!
we journey on and celebrate the spirit of adventure as we say
we're on our way
we're on our way
we're on our way
as the show comes to a close, the song is reprised with different lyrics as "we found our way"
we found our way
we found our way
our world is one big family
we make a brighter day
and then we say: let's celebrate!
new friends we meet are different but the same
we found our way
welcome to our journey!
we found our way
we found our way
our world is one big family
we make a brighter day
and then we say: let's celebrate!
new friends we meet are different but the same
we found our way ariel, escuchame, este mundo esta muy mal
la vida debajo del mar es mucho mejor que el mundo de allá arriba
tú crees que en otros lados las algas más verdes son
y sueñas con ir arriba que gran equivocación
no ves que tu propio mundo no tiene comparación
qué puede haber allá afuera que cause tal emoción
bajo del mar, bajo del mar
vive contenta siendo sirena eres feliz
sé que trabajan sin parar y bajo el sol para variar
mientras nosotros siempre flotamos bajo del mar
los peces son my felizes aquí tienen libertad
los peces allá estan tristes, sus casas son de cristal
la vida de nuestros peces muy larga no suele ser
si al dueño le apetece "a mi me van a comer"
bajo del mar, bajo del mar
nadie nos frie ni nos cocina en un sarten
si no te quieres arriesgar bajo del mar te quedaras
y sin problemas entre burbujas tu viviras
bajo del mar bajo del mar
bajo del mar bajo del mar
hay siempre ritmo en nuestro mundo al natural al natural
la mantarraya tocara y el esturión se le unira
siempre al ritmo, ritmo marino
bajo del mar
oye la flauta, oye el arpa y al contrabajo ponle atención
veras las trompes y el tambor disfruta de tu canción
con la marimba y el violín, las truchas bailando y otros cantando
y no olvidarnos de espadín que empieze la función
bajo del mar, bajo del mar
hay bailarinas son las sardinas ven a bailar
para qué quieres explorar si nuestra banda va a tocar
hay castañuelas son las almejas bajo del mar
y las almejas son tan jocosas, bajo del mar
el caracol es saxofonista
y las burbujas llenan la pista para que bailes en esta fiesta
bajo del mar spoken listen, everyone
there were objects so peculiar
they were not to be believed
all around, things to tantalize my brain
it's a world unlike anything i've ever seen
and as hard as i try
i can't seem to describe
like a most improbable dream
but you must believe when i tell you this
it's as real as my skull and it does exist
spoken here, let me show you
this is a thing called a present
the whole thing starts with a box
a box?
is it steel?
are there locks?
is it filled with a pox?
a pox
how delightful, a pox
spoken if you please...
just a box with bright-colored paper
and the whole thing's topped with a bow
a bow?
but why?
how ugly
what's in it?
what's in it?
that's the point of the thing, not to know!
it's a bat
will it bend?
it's a rat!
will it break?
perhaps it s the head that i found in the lake?
listen now, you don't understand
that's not the point of christmas land
spoken now, pay attention
we pick up an over-sized sock
and hang it like this on the wall
oh, yes! does it still have a foot?
let me see, let me look
is it rotted and covered with gook?
spoken um, let me explain...
there's no foot inside, but there's candy
or sometimes it's filled with small toys
small toys
do they bite?
do they snap?
or explode in a sack?
or perhaps they just spring out
and scare girls and boys
what a splendid idea
this christmas sounds fun
i fully endorse it
let's try it at once
everyone, please now, not so fast
there's something here that you don't quite grasp
spoken well, i may as well give them what they want...
and the best, i must confess, i have saved for the last
for the ruler of this christmas land
is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice
least that's what i've come to understand
and i've also heard it told
that he's something to behold
like a lobster, huge and red
and he sets out to slay with his rain gear on
carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
that is, so i've heard it said
and on a dark, cold night
under full moonlight
he flies into a fog
like a vulture in the sky
and they call him sandy claws
well, at least they're excited
but they don't understand
that special kind of feeling in christmas land
spoken oh, well... but peter, how do we get to neverland?
fly of course
fly?
it's easy!  all you have to do is...to...is to...is...to...huh!  that's funny!
what's the matter?  don't you know?
well, sure!  it's just that i never thought about it before.  say, that's it!  you think of a wonderful thought!
any happy little thought?
uh, huh!
like toys at christmas, sleigh bells, snow?
yup, watch me now, here i go!  it's easier than pie!
he can fly!
he can fly!
he flew!
now you try
i'll think of a mermaid's lagoon
underneath a magic moon
i'll think i'm in a pirate's cave
i'll think i'll be a indian brave
now everybody try...
one, two, three...
we can fly, we can fly, we can....
this won't do
what's the matter with you?
all it take is faith, trust
oh, and something i forgot!
dust!
dust
dust!
yep, just a little bit of pixie dust
now, think of the happiest things
it's the same as having wings
lets all try it, just once more
look we're rising off the floor
jiminy!
oh, my!  we can fly!
you can fly!
we can fly!
come on, everybody!
here we go!
off to neverland!
think of the presents you've brought
any merry little thought
think of christmas, think of snow
think of sleigh bells, here we go
like a reindeer in the sky
you can fly, you can fly
you can fly, you can fly
soon you'll zoom all around the room
all it takes is faith and trust
but the thing that's a positive must
is a little bit of pixie dust
the dust is a positive must
you can fly, you can fly
you can fly, you can fly
when there's a smile in your heart
there's no better time to start
it's a very simple plan
you can do what the birdies can
at least it's worth a try
you can fly, you can fly
you can fly, you can fly maybe you've heard of a terrible place
where the scoundrels of paris
collect in a lair
maybe you've heard of that mythical place
called the court of miracles
hello, you're there!
where the lame can walk
and the blind can see
but the dead don't talk
so you won't be around
to reveal what you've found
we have a method for spies and intruders
rather like hornets protecting their hive
here in the court of miracles
where it's a miracle if you get out alive!
justice is swift in the court of miracles
i am the lawyers and judge all in one
we like to get the trial over with quickly
because it's the sentence that's really the fun!
now that we've seen all the evidence
wait! i object!
overruled!
i object!
quiet!
dang!
we find you totally innocent
which is the worst crime of all
so you're going to hang! so here is a riddle to guess if you can
sing the bells of notre dame
what makes a monster and what makes a man?
sing the bells, bells, bells
bells, bells, bells, bells
bells, bells, bells, bells
whatever their pitch
you can feel them bewitch you
the rich and the ritual knells
of the bells of notre dame the earth is cold
the fields are bare
the branches fold against the wind that's everywhere
the birds move on
so they survive
when snow so deep
the bears all sleep to keep themselves alive
they do what they must for now
and trust in their plan
if i trust in mine, somehow i might find who i am
but where do i go from here?
so many voices ringing in my ear
which is the voice that i was meant to hear?
how will i know?
where do i go from here?
my world has changed and so have i
i've learned to choose
and even learned to say goodbye
the path ahead's so hard to see
it winds and bends but where it ends
depends on only me
in my heart i don't feel part of so much i've known
now it seems it's time to start
a new life on my own
but where do i go from here?
so many voices ringing in my ear
which is the voice that i was meant to hear?
how will i know?
where do i go from here? something's up with jack
something's up with jack
don't know if we're ever
going to get him back
he's all alone up there
locked away inside
never says a word
hope he hasn't died
something's up with jack
something's up with jack
christmas time is buzzing in my skull
will it let me be? i cannot tell
there are so many things i cannot grasp
when i think i've got it, and then at last
through my bony fingers it does slip
like a snowflake in a fiery grip
something's here i'm not quite getting
though i try, i keep forgetting
like a memory long since past
here in an instant, gone in a flash
what does it mean?
what does it mean?
in these little bric-a-brac
a secret's waiting to be cracked
these dolls and toys confuse me so
confound it all, i love it though
simple objects, nothing more
but something's hidden through a door
though i do not have the key
something's there i cannot see
what does it mean?
what does it mean?
spoken what does it mean? hmm...
i've read these christmas books so many times
i know the stories and i know the rhymes
i know the christmas carols all by heart
my skull's so full, it's tearing me apart
as often as i've read them, something's wrong
so hard to put my bony finger on
or perhaps it's really not as deep
as i've been led to think
am i trying much too hard?
of course! i've been too close to see
the answer's right in front of me
right in front of me
it's simple really, very clear
like music drifting in the air
invisible, but everywhere
just because i cannot see it
doesn't mean i can't believe it
you know, i think this christmas thing
it's not as tricky as it seems
and why should they have all the fun?
it should belong to anyone
not anyone, in fact, but me
why, i could make a christmas tree
and there's no reason i can find
i couldn't handle christmas time
i bet i could improve it too
and that's exactly what i'll do
spoken hee, hee, hee, hee! eureka! i've got it! this year, christmas will be ours! so this is love, mhm
so this is love
so this is what makes life divine
i'm all aglow, mhm
and now i know
the key to all heaven is mine
my heart has wings, mhm
and i can fly
i'll touch every star in the sky
so this is the miracle that i've been dreaming of
mhm, mhm
so this is love every time she'd find a minute
that's the time that they begin it
cinderelly, cinderelly

never run, walk away, say good-night, not good-day
clear the aisle but never smile at mister crocodile who's that coming down the street?

ทำอย่างนี้ตั้งแต่จำความ แม้ไม่รู้เลยว่าทำไม
исках да съм най добра във всичко но тази вода ме
hafið, sama hvað ég berst gegn því
ez a lázas szív fura ritmust ver csakis engem hív ez a titkos hely
te vahi mataia e te moemoea a te ho'i e
а в глазах каждый день океан бескрайний
cache un trésor que tous ignorent
si el viento en mi vela he de acompañarme
σε ποιον να πω, το κρυφό μικρό μου ένοχο μυστικό
ya sé que aquí todos en la isla piensan
ta’r som fisk i vandet, alle gør hvad de nu kan
바다 섬에 사는 사람 모두
המזל, הוא איתנו, אולי אותי הוא גם אוהב
jag kan styra väl om jag finner tron
ge ett starkt befäl om jag tar reson
doch es passt in mir, ziemlich fort von hier
was ist los mit mir?
credo che quella luce potrà guidarmi
daleko stąd marzenia są
e parece que a luz chama por mim e já sabe
请告诉我，我应该去带，什么是未来
i ten pás nebe dál objímá a vábí
chẳng ai biết đâu, rằng xa thế nào
met de wind in mijn rug op de zee kan ik zeilen
私は行くのよ whistling
pu-puh-puh-puh-puhhpupuuuh

whistling
...flute solo & whistle...
...up tempo keyboard... cinderella, you're as lovely as your name
cinderella, you're a sunset in a frame
though you're dressed in rags
you wear an air of queenly grace
anyone can see a throne
would be your proper place
cinderella, if you give your heart a chance
it will lead you, to the kingdom of romance
there you'll see your dreams unfold
cinderella, cinderella

over field and hill
is a military goal
is a military goal
hup! two! three! four!
dress it up two three four!
by the ranks or single file
over every jungle mile
oh we stamp and crush
through the underbrush
in the "miritelly" style
in the military style
hup! two! three! four!
keep it hup! two! three! four!
to the rear... ho!
company... halt! forget about that guy
forget about the way you fell into his eyes
forget about his charms
forget about the way he held you in his arms
walking on air's obnoxious
the thrill
the chill
will make you nauseous
and you'll never get enough
just forget about love!
forget about romance
forget about the way your heart begins to dance
then you feel the blush
when he's spouting out some sentimental mush
love really is revolting!
it's even worse than when you're moulting
enough of this fluff!
just forget about love!
i had almost forgotten the way it felt
when he held out his hand for mine
my heart all a-flutter
oh, how i shudder
the first time we kissed
it won't be missed!
forget about 'is touch
i can't forget about his touch
in the scheme of things
it doesn't matter much
it matters so much
you're better on your own
a meal becomes a banquet
when you eat alone
hmm-mm-mm-mm
:
love's filled with compromises
:
and don't you hate those big surprises?
a cozy rendezvous
oh, please!
candlelight for two
oh, geez!
look you're calling my bluff!
i can't just
:
forget about love!
i can't forget about my heart
i can't forget about my heart
and how it felt
to fall for you right from the start
i'm still falling
whatever we may do
whatever we may do
you are here for me
and i'll be there for you
i'll be there
:
to wish, to want, to wander
to find the sun
through rain and thunder
a cozy rendezvous
yes, please!
candlelight for two
oh, geez!
enough is enough!
:
we can't forget about love! you are my world my darling
what a wonderful world i see
you are the song i'm singing
you're my beautiful melody
darling, we better be going
look at her isn't she glowing?
she looks divine
and you look exquisite
but look at the time
couldn't be is it?
the crew is awaiting your orders
we're sailing away from the borders
steady boy steady
ahoy there, they're coming!
trumpeters ready
drummers start drumming
down to the sea we go
down to a world i know
there's never been
not ever before
a child born of sea and shore
down to the sea we go
down to the world below
a journey to bless
a princess to be
under the sun, and under the sea
ariel is coming
what's all the big commotion
that's spreading through the ocean
from sea to shining sea laughs
there is no hesitating
today we're celebrating
ariel's melody
today when triton's daughter
comes back here to the water
we're gonna have a spree
the boat is nearer now
i think i hear her now
ariel's melody
lad-da-di-da
up from the sea we rise
up to the world of skies
there's never been
not ever before
a child born of sea and shore
up from the sea we rise
up to the world of skies
forever to be
together as one
under the sea...
and under the sun...
this is your world my darling
one world the land and sea
my hope for you for always
is that your heart will part of me
down to the sea we go
up from the sea
down to the world we know
together we come
forever to be
under one sun
the land and the sea following the leader, the leader, the leader
we're following the leader wherever he may go
we won't be home till morning, till morning
we won't be home till morning
because he told us so
tee dum, tee dee

we're out for fun
and this is the game we play:

and sing your troubles away
with a teedle ee dum

...for some bacon?
yum, yum, yum!

yum, yum!
you could be a big pig too
oy! ok, get a grip, get the hang of this flipper
it's like slipping two feet into one big, huge slipper
this way left, but which is right?
well now i'll be circling in circles all night
oh, so this is forward? no problem
i can't believe i can do this and more
to swim in the sea like i walk on the shore
out of my shell, not closed up like a clam
look out sea
this is me
here i am!
for a moment all of me
is alive and at home in the sea
i'm swirling and twirling so graceful and grand
not stubbing my toes, getting stuck in the sand
for a moment life is cool
i'm a splash in the world's biggest pool
this is more than my thoughts ever thought it could be
for a moment, just a moment, lucky me
if only for one moment
i had shared with you all i know
the sea wouldn't be a mystery
oh why did you have to go?
everything's newer
and brighter and bluer
and truer to life than before
watch me soar!
for a moment i can shine
got a grin and a fin that works fine
my fingers are wrinkly and i really don't care
if all the curls have curled out of my hair
for a moment i can feel
all the dreams i've been dreaming are real
wish my mother could hear it
the sea is my song
for a moment, just a moment i belong
i will find you, my darling
and the moment that i do
i'll hold you close, my melody
and sing the song of the sea
with you
sing the song of the sea with you
for a moment, just a moment
i belong we're your friends
we're your friends
we're your friends to the bitter end
when you're are down
who comes around
to pluck you up
when you are down
and when you're outside, looking in
who's there to open the door?
that's what friends are for!
who's always eager to extend
a friendly claw?
that's what friends are for!
and when you're lost in dire need
who's at your side at lightning speed?
we're friends of every creature
comin' down the pike
in fact we never met an animal
we didn't like, didn't like
so you can see
we're friends in need
and friends in need
are friends indeed
we'll keep you safe
in the jungle forevermore
that's what friends are for! i know you
i walked with you once upon a dream
i know you
the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a glem
yet i know it's true
that visions are seldom all they seem
but if i know you i know what you'll do
you'll love me at once
the way you did once upon a dream ohé, ohé

forward, backward, inward, outward
come and join the chase
nothing could be drier
than a jolly caucus race
backward, forward, outward, inward
bottom to the top
never a beginning
there can never be a stop
to skipping, hopping, tripping fancy free and gay
started it tomorrow
but will finish yesterday
'round and 'round and 'round we go
until forevermore
for once we were behind
but now we find we are be-
foreward, backward, inward, outward
come and joing hte chase
nothing could be drier
than a jolly caucus race! come out, moon
come out, wishing star
come out, come out
wherever you are
i'm out here in the dark
all alone and wide awake
come and find me
i'm empty and i'm cold
and my heart's about to break
come and find me
i need you to come here and find me
'cause without you i'm totally lost
i've hung a wish on ev'ry star
it hasn't done much good so far
i can only dream of you
wherever you are
i'll hear you laugh
i'll see you smile
i'll be with you
just for a while
but when the morning comes
and the sun begins to rise
i will lose you
because it's just a dream
when i open up my eyes
i will lose you
i used to believe in forever
but forever's too good to be true
i've hung a wish on ev'ry star
it hasn't done much good so far
i don't know what else to do
except to try to dream of you
and wonder if you're dreaming too
wherever you are
wherever you are come along
will there be sunshine shinin'?
will we find a silver linin'?
come along
sing a song
when today becomes tomorrow
will we find joy or sorrow?
sing a song
is it wrong?
to put all my hopes together
and wish for something better
is it wrong?
to belong?
to face the future with another
who means more than any other is to belong
we'll paint the grey clouds
with pretty rainbow hues
and we'll brush the gloom away
and save it for a rainy day
rainy day
oh, today
if troubles cast a shadow
and shadows make the sun afraid to stay
why, it's ok
'cause there'll be sunshine shinin'
and we'll find a silver linin' another day

ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da pour toi, je suis l'ignorante sauvage
tu me parles de ma différence, je crois sans malveillance
mais si dans ton langage, tu emploies le mot "sauvage"
c'est que tes yeux sont remplis de nuages, de nuages
tu crois que la terre t'appartient toute entière
pour toi, ce n'est qu'un tapis de poussière
moi je sais que la pierre, l'oiseau et les fleurs
ont une vie, ont un esprit et un cœur
pour toi l'étranger ne porte le nom d'homme
que s'il te ressemble et pense à ta façon
mais en marchant dans ses pas, tu te questionnes
es-tu sûr, au fond de toi, d'avoir raison ?
comprends-tu le chant d'espoir du loup qui meurt d'amour ?
les pleurs des chats sauvages au petit jour ?
entends-tu chanter les esprits de la montagne ?
peux-tu peindre en mille couleurs l'air du vent ?
peux-tu peindre en mille couleurs l'air du vent ?
courons dans les forêts d'or et de lumière
partageons-nous les fruits mûrs de la vie
la terre nous offre ses trésors, ses mystères
le bonheur, ici-bas, n'a pas de prix
je suis fille des torrents, soeur des rivières
la loutre et le héron sont mes amis
et nous tournons tous ensemble, au fil des jours
dans un cercle, une ronde à l'infini !
là-haut, le sycomore dort
comme l'aigle royal, il trône impérial
les créatures de la nature ont besoin d'air pur
et qu'importe la couleur de leur peau
chantons tous en chœur les chansons de la montagne
en rêvant de pouvoir peindre l'air du vent...
mais la terre n'est que poussière
tant que l'homme ignore comment
il peut peindre en mille couleurs l'air du vent !  ariel, écoute-moi !
chez les humains, c'est la pagaille !
la vie sous la mer,
c'est bien mieux que la vie qu'ils ont là-haut sur la terre !
le roseau est toujours plus vert,
dans le marais d'à côté !
toi t'aimerais bien vivre sur terre,
bonjour la calamité !
regarde bien le monde qui t'entoure,
dans l'océan parfumé
on fait carnaval tous les jours,
mieux, tu ne pourras pas trouver !
sous l'océan, sous l'océan,
doudou c'est bien mieux,
tout le monde est heureux,
sous l'océan
là-haut, ils bossent toute la journée,
esclavagés et prisonniers,
pendant qu'on plonge,
comme des éponges,
sous l'océan
chez nous, les poissons se fendent la pipe,
les vagues sont un vrai régal
là-haut, ils s'écaillent et ils flippent,
a tourner dans leur bocal
le bocal, faut dire, c'est l'extase,
chez leurs copains cannibales
si missié poisson n'est pas sage:
il finira dans la poêle !
oh non !
sous l'océan, sous l'océan,
y a pas d' court-bouillon,
pas de soupe de poisson,
pas de marmiton
pour la tambouille, on leur dit non !
sous l'océan, y a pas d'hameçons
on déambule, on fait des bulles,
sous l'océan !
sous l'océan !
sous l'océan !
sous l'océan !
la vie est super,
mieux que sur la terre, je te le dis
oui, je te le dis ! hi hi !
tu vois l'esturgeon et la raie,
se sont lancés dans le reggae
on a le rythme,
c'est d' la dynamite,
sous l'océan !
l'triton au flûtiau,
la carpe joue de la harpe,
la rascasse d' la basse,
c'est les rois du rap
maquereau au saxo,
turbo au bango,
le lieu est le dieu de la soul
la raie au djembé,
le gardon au violon
les soles rock'n'rollent,
le thon garde le ton
le bar et le sprat se marrent et s'éclatent,
vas-y souffle mon doudou !

ouais!
sous l'océan !
sous l'océan !
sous l'océan !
sous l'océan !
quand la sardine biguine des biguines,
ça balance, ça swingue !
ils ont du sable, ça c'est certain,
nous le jazz-band et tous les copains !
on a les clims clams,
pour faire une jim-jam,
sous l'océan !
les limaces des mers,
au rythme d'enfer,
sous l'océan !
et les bigorneaux,
pour donner l' tempo,
c'est frénétique,
c'est fantastique,
on est en transe,
faut que ça balance,
sous l'océan ! hey there, hi there, ho there

vi er trængt af fjender, hvor vi end går hen
hvad skal jeg med kvinder, når jeg bad om mænd?
værre pjok end jer, har ingen set
lad mig sige det her og nu
det kun mænd, rigtige mænd
jeg kan bruge
:
rolig som en klippe, men når du slår til
viser du med ildhu, at du kan og vil
i' en slatten, bleg og ynkelig flok
hvem sku' i dog kunne true?
det kun mænd, rigtige mænd
jeg kan bruge
:
jeg puster som en blæsebælg
sig farvel til dem derhjemme
det med gymnastikken faldt mig aldrig nemt
den fyr skræmmer folk ihjel
ser han ting jeg helst vil gemme?
ku' jeg bare svømme, var det ikke så slemt
:
vær en mand
vi må være rappe som flodens bølger
vær en mand
med samme kraft som et tordenvejr
vær en mand
vi må ha' styrke som tusind flammer
et slør af mystik, som månens blege skær
:
tiden løber fra os, snart slår fjenden til
følger i mine ordrer, er der håb måske
du vil aldrig, du til krigens gru
så tag hjem, du' færdig nu
det kun mænd, rigtige mænd
jeg kan bruge
:
vær en mand
vi må være rappe som flodens bølger
vær en mand
med samme kraft som et tordenvejr
vær en mand
vi må ha' styrke som tusind flammer
et slør af mystik, som månens blege skær

bird whistles

vocalizing with birds whistling

life is just a bright sunny day
your cares fade away
and your heart is young

all the world seems to waken anew
rejoicing with you
as the song is sung
there's no use in grumbling
when raindrops come tumbling
remember, you're the one
who can fill the world with sunshine
when you smile and you sing
everything is in tune and it's spring
and life flows along
with a smile and a song
spoken
i really feel quite happy now
i'm sure i'll get along somehow!
everything's going to be all right
but i do need a place to sleep at night
i can't sleep in the ground like you
or in a tree the way you do!
and i'm sure no nest could possibly be big enough for me
maybe you know where i can stay?
in the woods somewhere?
you do!  will you take me there? and now, everybody, it's time for you to join in the fun as we kick off our celebration finale. the natives are getting restless - let's have a party!

though the river's proud and strong
he will chose the smoothest course
that's why rivers live so long
they're steady as the steady beating drum a dream is a wish your heart makes
when you're fast asleep
in dreams, you will lose your heartaches
whatever you wish for, you keep
have faith in your dreams and someday
your rainbow will come smiling through
no matter how your heart is grieving
if you keep on believing
the dream that you wish will come true
oh, that clock!
oh, kill joy!
i hear you
come on, get up, you say
time to start another day
even he orders me around
well, there's one thing
they can't order me to stop dreaming
and maybe someday
the dreams that i wish will come true
da dum, da-da dum, da-da dum-dum...
no matter how your heart is grieving
if you keep on believing
the dream that you wish will come true dies irae, dies illa

we dare not stop or waste a drop
so let the paint be spread!
we're painting the roses red

and many a tear we shed
because we know
they'll cease to grow
in fact they'll soon be dead!
and yet we go ahead
painting the roses red!
painting the roses red
we're painting the roses red!
oh, pardon me
but mister three
why must you paint them red?
well the fact is, miss, we planted the white roses by mistake!
and -
the queen
she likes them red
if she saw white instead
she'd raise her voice
and each of us would quickly lose his head!
since this is the thought we dread
we're painting the roses red!
oh, dear, then let me help you!

painting the roses red...
we're painting the roses red!
don't tell the queen that's what you've seen
or tell her what we've said!
we're painting the roses red
yes, painting the roses red!
not pink -
not green -
not aquamarine!
we're painting the roses red! well, a mother, a real mother
is the most wonderful person in the world
she's the angel voice that bids you good night
kisses your cheek, whispers, "sleep tight"
your mother and mine
your mother and mine
the helping hand that guides you along
whether you're right, whether you're wrong
your mother and mine
your mother and mine
what makes mothers all that they are
might as well ask, "what makes a star?"
ask your heart to tell you her worth
your heart will say, "heaven on earth"
another word for divine
your mother and mine  silent as the snowflake in the night
holy is the spirit of this night
all the world is calm and peaceful
all the world is bright and joyful
spirit of love and child of peace
love unending that shall not cease

peace, be still quando eu for rei ninguém vai me vencer em nenhum duelo!
— eu nunca vi um rei leão sem juba e sem pelo!
a juba que eu vou ter vai ver, será de arrasar
e todo mundo vai tremer quando me ouvir urrar!
— haha, mas por enquanto eu digo que não sei, uáá!
e o que eu quero mais é ser rei!
— ainda falta muito pra isso, amo, se pensa que -
ninguém dizendo!
— ora quando eu digo que, é
não faça isso!

vou dar um sumiço!
— ah, olha aqui!
livre pra poder viver!
— isso não é bem assim!
pra fazer o que quiser!
— acho que agora é a hora, de a gente conversar... ui!
reis não tem que ter calau nenhum pra aconselhar
eu vejo que a monarquia assim vai fracassar!
eu vou me embora daqui da áfrica!
eu vou me aposentar!
cuidar dessa criança eu não irei...
e o que eu quero mais, é ser rei!
olhe pra esquerda!
olhe pra direita!
pra que lado olhe, eu estou em foco!

seus amigos todos vão vibrar
quando a boa nova se espalhar
e o novo rei, simba vai reinar
e o que eu quero mais é ser rei!
e o que eu quero mais é ser rei!
e o que eu quero mais é ser rei! te crees señor de todo territorio
la tierra sólo quieres poseer
mas toda roca, planta o creatura
viva esta, tiene un alma, es un ser
tu crees que igual a ti es todo el mundo
y hablas como un gran conocedor
mas sigue las pisadas de un extraño
y mil sorpresas hallaras alrededor
escuchaste aullar los lobos a la luna azul
o has visto a un lince sonreir
o unirte a la voz de las montañas
y colores en el viento descubrir
y colores en el viento descubrir
corramos por veredas en el bosque
probemos de sus frutos el sabor
descubre que riquezas te rodean
sin pensar un instante en su valor
hermanos son el rio y la lluvia
amigos somos todos como ves
vivimos muy felices tan unidos
en un ciclo fraternal que eterno es
escuchaste aullar los lobos a la luna azul
o has visto a un lince sonreir
o unirte a la voz de las montañas
y colores en el viento descubrir
y colores en el viento descubrir
cuan alto el arbol sera
si lo cortas hoy, nunca se sabra
ni oiras aullar los lobos a la luna azul
sea blanca o morena nuestra piel
todos tenemos que cantar con las montañas
y colores en el viento descubrir
si no entiendes que hay aqui
sólo es tierra para ti
sin colores en el viento descubrir once i met a man
a thief, a cad
with a selfish plan
that made me mad
love set his heart aglow
so sweet, so strange
but first he had to show
that he could change
when i was in a spot
my back against the wall
he gave it all he got
and dared to risk it all
things were getting rough
but he answered the call
he had to stay tough
and dare to risk it all
he was brave enough
to finally dare to risk it all
putting yourself first
led you astray
so now it seems you're cursed
to your dismay
to make up for your deeds
and prove you've grown
try putting other's needs
before your own
your family's in a spot
their backs against the wall
so give it all you got
and dare to risk it all
if things start getting rough
just answer the call
you have to stay tough
and dare to risk it all
i know you're brave enough
to finally dare to risk it all
to save the ones you love
you have to rise above
the curse is sure to fall
but only if you dare, dare to risk it all dum de dum de dum de dum

not me, your grace! the ace, the ace!
you?
no, two!
the deuce you say?
not me! the trey!
that's enough!  off with their heads!

you see, i washed them both today
and i can't do nothing with 'em
ho hum the tune is dumb

i chased a polecat up a tree
way out on upon a limb
and when he got the best of me
i got the worst of him

you're in for a pleasant surprise
i've wasted time
i've wasted me
so say i'm slow for my age
a late bloomer
okay, i agree
that i've been one rotten kid
some son, some pride, and some joy
but i'll get over these lousin' up
messin' up, screwin' up times
you'll see, ma, now comes the better part
someone's gonna make good
cross his stupid heart
make good and finally make you
proud of your boy
tell me that i've been a louse and loafer
you won't get a fight here, no ma'am
say i'm a goldbrick, a goof-off, no good
but that couldn't be all that i am
water flows under the bridge
let it pass, let it go
there's no good reason that you should believe me
not yet, i know, but
someday and soon
i'll make you proud of your boy
though i can't make myself taller
or smarter or handsome or wise
i'll do my best, what else can i do?
since i wasn't born perfect like dad or you
mom, i will try to
try hard to make you
proud of your boy who's the leader of the club

danger to danger we go flying
completely unafraid of dying

comment est-ce qu'un monde qui fait d'aussi beaux objets pourrait être aussi barbare?
tous ces secrets
que j'ai gardé
ne crois-tu pas que les fées m'ont comblée?
ne crois-tu pas que je suis bien trop gâtée par la vie?
vois ces trésors et ces merveilles
toutes ces richesses qui brillent comme des soleils
en voyant ça tu te dis:
"oui, c'est un paradis"
j'ai des gadgets, des trucs chocs, des truc chouettes
j'ai des couics et des couacs à gogo
tu veux un tire-baba? j'en ai des tas!
mais tout ça m'indifère et m'ennuie
moi je voudrais parcourir le monde
moi je voudrais voir le monde danser
le voir marcher sur ses....
comment ça s'appelle? ah! pieds
on ne va nulle part en battant des nageoires
il faut des jambes pour sauter et danser
flâner le long de ces....

si l'hommes marche, si l'homme court
si'il peut sur terre rêver au grand jour
comme j'aimerais, si je pouvais
partir là-bas
je donnerais tout çe que j'ai pour partir d'ici
pour carresser les grains doré du sable chaud
les hommes comprennent, j'en suis certaine
et leure filles peuvent rêver sans frayeur
j'en suis certaines
femmes sirènes, femmes humaines
j'ai fais mon choix
moi je veux savoir, moi je veux pouvoir
poser des questions et qu'on me réponde
qu'est-ce que le feu et pourquoi est-ce qu'il quoi déjà.... brûle?
un jour viendra, je partirai, je partirai sans aucun regret

try to remember that magic happens
if you just believe! you showed me the world when i was all locked up inside
you reached out your hand and took me on
a magic carpet ride
one look at your smile
and i could see the light shining ev'rywhere
people like you don't come out of thin air
you don't understand, there is so much that you don't see
just think if you can what growing up
had to be like for me
your father's a man who taught you who you are
mine was never there
so how can you say i don't come out of thin air?
there's so much i want to know
you've got the chance to learn
if it means i'd have to go
i'll be right here when you return
our wedding can wait i love you
i think it's worth this small delay maybe you're right
and won't it to be great to have your father
see our wedding day?
it isn't too late i've waited so long to learn the truth
and now at last we can finally say
your father is really there
there's so much that we might share
and you'll finally learn you don't come out of thin air sleeping beauty fair
gold of sunshine in your hair
lips that shame the red, red rose
dreaming of true love in slumber repose
one day he will come
riding out of the dawn
and you'll awaken to love's first kiss
till then, sleeping beauty, sleep on
one day you'll awaken to love's first kiss
till then, sleeping beauty, sleep on i give myself very good advice
but i very seldom follow it
that explains the trouble that i'm always in
be patient, is very good advice
but the waiting makes me curious
and i'd love the change
should something strange begin
well i went along my merry way
and i never stopped to reason
i should have know there'd be a price to pay
someday...someday
i give myself very good advice
but i very seldom follow it
will i ever learn to do the things i should?
will i ever learn to do the things i should? english idina menzel:

on the grass or the ground
i don't mind that i find myself
crawling around
but i dream that someday
i'll discover a way
to be part of the heart of the sky
i might leave very soon
i might soar through the air
i might weave a cocoon
hung with silk fine and fair
but i hope that someday
i'll discover a way
to be part of the heart of the sky
oh, there must be a reason
for this time and season
as long and as hard as it seems
to be bound to the ground
when there's heaven around
i'll just keep holding on to my dreams
safe and warm, i was born
in this fur covered coat
but i'd trade it for wings
built to flutter and float
so i'll build up my strength
and hang on to the hope
i'll be part of the heart of the sky
maybe i will be part of the heart of the sky i know you
i walked with you once upon a dream
i know you
that gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
yet i know it's true
that visions are seldom all they seem
but if i know you
i know what you'll do
you'll love me at once

pip: i’m only gonna move aninch at a time
the speed of a snail
freddy: buddy, you’ll be fine
pip: if i’m too quick, i slip and i slide. but if i go sloth-mode, i’ll make it to the opposite side. whoa, whoa! i’m gonna take it steady and slow. whoa, whoa! i’m gonna go real steady and slow
freddy: go, pip!
pip: whoa!
freddy: don’t trip
pip: whoa!
freddy: get sunny home
pip: look, i’ve only got a few more steps to go~!
freddy: careful!
pip: whoa~!
pip: look at me go!
freddy: you’re on a roll!
pip: as long as i take it steady and slow
pip: here we go!
freddy: whoa-oa-oa!
pip: i’m gonna go real steady and-
steady and slow today's the day
in only a matter of moments
you'll all be on your way
what lurks around the corner
not a soul can say
but i can guess
more or less
hidden dangers
great duress
ah, the moments of glory
is close at hand
hoo, wee
it's gonna be grand
adventure is a wonderful thing
pack only the essentials
i'll tell you what to bring
your strength
your nerve
your hearts
your wits
and for skullosaurus attacks
first aid kits
adventure is a hoot and a half
you'll face unearthly dangers
and look at them and laugh
the claws
the teeth
the chase
the thrill
you'll never want to come home
maybe you never will
that's the beauty of adventure
it's strictly sink or float
it runs you 'til you're ragged
then it grabs you by the throat
you struggle to survive it
though the chances are remote
hoo, hoo, lucky you
wish i was coming too
adventure is a wonderful thing
and you
general pooh
off you go
marching high and low
your friend
waits at the end
right here
take a look
the map is perfectly clear
with your excellent sense of direction
you've nothing to fear
through the quicksand
of the chasms
tempting fate
and fighting spasms
dodging avalanching boulders
remember, christopher robin's fate
rests completely on your shoulders, pooh
that's the beauty of adventure
the trembling and the dread
oh, i can't think of another thing
i'd rather do instead
hoo, hoo, lucky you
tally ho, and toodle-ooh
ready now, noble chin
chest out, tummy in
make a fracas, have a fling
drop a postcard, give a ring
get the lead out, time to swing
whoop dee doo, and badda bing
adventure is a wonderful thing my own home, my own home
my own home, my own home
father's hunting in the forest
mother's cooking in the home
i must go to fetch the water
'til the day that i'm grown
'til i'm grown, 'til i'm grown
i must go to fetch the water
'til the day that i'm grown
then i will have a handsome husband
and a daughter of my own
and i'll send her to fetch the water
i'll be cooking in the home
then i'll send her to fetch the water
i'll be cooking in my home when you're the best of friends
having so much fun together
you're not even aware you're such a funny pair
you're the best of friends
life's a happy game
you can clown around forever
neither one of you sees your natural boundaries
life's one happy game
if only the world wouldn't get in the way
if only people would just let you play
they say you're both being fools
you're breaking all the rules
they can't understand
the magic of your wonderland
when you're the best of friends
sharing all that you discover
when these moments have passed
we'll let friendship last
who can say, there's a way!
oh, i hope
i hope it never ends
'cause you're the best of friends   elsa

dans le salon
laissez entrer cet air, il sent si bon
et mettez les petits plats dans les grands
j'étais seule dans ces longs couloirs
il n'y avait pas de bal le soir
enfin nous entrons dans l'air du temps
les invités seront bien vivants
et tant pis si cela dérange
mais, moi, j'avais tellement hâte que ça change!
et je vais fêter ce renouveau
dans ma robe de satin
je vais fêter ce renouveau
en dansant jusqu'au matin
enflammée, exaltée, surexcitée
ils peuvent bien dire ce qu'ils veulent
je vais fêter ce renouveau
je ne serai plus seule
j'ai hâte d'accueillir tous les invités!
et si je rencontrais l'homme de ma vie?
ce soir je serai la plus belle
dans une tenue des plus formelles
une jeune fille raffinée et pleine de grâce
il va apparaître tout à coup
ce bel inconnu qui saura tout
le chocolat m'aidera à faire face!
nous parlerons toute la soirée
et je me sentirai bizarre
car changer de vie c'est tout un art!
je vais fêter ce renouveau
dans la magie d'une histoire!
je vais fêter ce renouveau
qui me donne tellement d'espoir
je sais que ce n'est pas raisonnable
de rêver de romance
mais je vais fêter ce renouveau
je tenterai ma chance!
cache tes pouvoirs
n'en parle pas
fais attention
le secret survivra
sereine
sans peine
tu régneras
un seul faux pas
et tout le monde saura
mais ce n'est qu'une seule journée
ce n'est qu'une seule journée!
la pression est si forte
la pression est si forte!
dites aux gardes qu'il faut ouvrir les portes!
les portes!
je vais fêter ce renouveau
cache tes pouvoirs n'en parle pas
qui m'apporte ce dont j'ai rêvé
fais attention le secret survivra
je veux quitter ma tour d'ivoire
sois sage
trouver l'amour ce soir!
pas d'états d'âmes
de sentiments
je sens que c'est le bon moment
c'est maintenant ou jamais
et je vais fêter ce renouveau
je vais fêter ce renouveau

state your name and business
that's manners! j'aime pas quand t'as l'air malheureux gaston
et complètement raplapla
tout le monde voudrait être dans ta peau, gaston
même quand c'est pas la grande joie
de tout le village, c'est toi le chouchou
c'est toi le préféré de la bande
toutes les femmes devant toi sont à genoux
et c'est pas difficile à comprendre ...
le plus beau, c'est gaston
le plus costaud, c'est gaston
et personne n'a un cou de taureau comme gaston
un caïd qui a du chien et des manières
et du chic et de la prestance
demandez à tony, dick ou norbert
ils vous diront tout de suite sincèrement ce qu'ils en pensent
le plus chouette, c'est gaston
la vedette, c'est gaston!
et personne n'a comme lui une fossette au menton
j'ai un corps d'apollon, du plomb dans la tête!
ah, quel champion ce gaston!
hip-hip hourra, hourra hip-hip!
gaston, sept sur sept
tout le reste vaut tripette
le plus fort, c'est gaston
le plus sport, c'est gaston
quand tu le mets sur un ring
personne mord comme gaston!
c' qu'il est grand, c' qu'il est beau et bien bâti
çà c'est pas du biceps en papier!
il n'est pas rabougri, ni riquiqui
c'est vrai! et mon torse velu fait ma célébrité!
le plus classe, c'est gaston
le plus coriace, c'est gaston
au concours de crachats, personne crache comme gaston!
je suis vraiment très doué en expectoration...
c'est bon mon gaston!
quand j'étais petit, je gobais quat' douzaines d'oeufs
pour être fort, pour me sentir à l'aise
maintenant qu' je suis grand, j'en avale quarante-neuf
c'est pour çà que je suis le roi des balèzes!
personne vise comme gaston
personne frise comme gaston
et personne n'a les bottes ni les chemises de gaston
je collectionne les trophées, j'en ai plein la maison!
c'est toi le champion ... gaston! a whole new world
a whole new life
for you and me!
a whole new world... joyfully now to our princess we come
bringing gifts and all good wishes, too
we pledge our loyalty anew

health to the princess
wealth to the princess
long live the princess aurora!
hail to the king!
hail to the queen!
hail to the princess aurora! every girl can be a princess, any dream can be
close your eyes and see
a magic wand and soon you've gone
from just you to royalty
you don't need a grand old castle rising in the air
maids to brush your hair
your heart is pure, you're thoughtful
surely princess, you're almost there
why just putting on a tiara
and you aren't the same old you
my life changed so completely
by just putting on a shoe, who knew
every girl can be a princess
fashion can be learned, heads can still be turned
by your sweet face, the style and grace
you know you've already earned
hold your head high and keep smiling
'cause that's just what a princess does
you're as beloved and beguiling
as ever a princess was
every girl can be a princess, all that's left to do
is find a prince for you, a prince who's bold
who'll hold you your whole life through
the most perfect princess is you faites place, au prince ali!
quelle grâce, le prince ali!
bande de veinards,
dégagez le bazar.
et vous allez voir,
c´ que vous allez voir.
venez applaudir, acclamer la superstar!
fêtez ce grand jour,
clochettes et tambours,
venez adorer l´idole!
prince ali, sa seigneurie,
ali ababoua.
a genoux, prosternez-vous,
soyez ravis!
pas de panique, on se calme!
criez vive ali, salam!
venez voir le plus beau spectacle d´arabie.
prince ali, plus fort que lui,
je n´en connais pas.
qui vous porte d´abu dhabi,
a bout de bras.
il a vaincu une armée,
tout seul avec son épée!
la terreur des ennemis, c´est prince ali!
il a cent trois chameaux et chamelles...
ne sont-ils pas mignons, simone?
des caravanes de paons, dix par van...
tout à fait thierry, j´adore leur pull!
des gorilles qu´ils protègent de leurs ailes.
ce zoo est un souk,
corne de bouc!
c´est une super ménagerie!
prince ali, oui c´est bien lui,
ali ababoua!
quel physique, c´est magnifique,
il est charmant.
il y a du monde au balcon,
moi, j´ai du voile au menton.
et tout le monde s´évanouit pour prince ali.
venez voir ses deux cents singes persans.
c´est payant, et pourtant, c´est gratuit.
serviteurs et esclaves travaillent pour lui,
fiers de le servir, c´est le plus grand,
on lui obéit, et chacun donnerait sa vie,
pour ali... vive ali!
prince ali, oui c´est bien lui,
ali ababoua, est ici, pour votre fille,
si jolie.
voilà pourquoi, en cortège,
cet amoureux vous assiège.
avec trente éléphants qui jouent les acrobates,
des ours et puis des lions, au son du clairon.
ses quarante fakirs, sa batterie de chefs,
ses oiseaux qui crient,
faites place, au prince ali! and finally, everything worked out just fine
christmas was saved, though there wasn't much time
but after that night, things were never the same
each holiday now knew the other one's name
and though that one christmas, things got out of hand
i'm still rather fond of that skeleton man
so, many years later, i thought i'd drop in
and there was old jack, still looking quite thin
with four or five skeleton children at hand
playing strange little tunes in their xylophone band
and i asked old jack, "do you remember the night
when the sky was so dark and the moon shone so bright?
when a million small children pretending to sleep
nearly didn't have christmas at all, so to speak?
and would, if you could, turn that mighty clock back
to that long, fateful night, now, think carefully, jack
would you do the whole thing all over again
knowing what you know now, knowing what you knew then?"
and he smiled, like the old pumpkin king that i knew
then turned and asked softly of me, "wouldn't you?" shh, everyone listen
various animal noises
it is time
drumming gradually intensifies

searching everywhere for something true
you're at the age of not believing
when all the make believe is through
when you've set aside your childhood heroes
and your dreams are lost upon a shelf
you're at the age of not believing
and worst of all you doubt yourself
you're a castaway where no one hears you
on a barren isle in a lonely sea
where did all the happy endings go?
where can all the good times be?
you must face the age of not believing
doubting everything you ever knew
until at last you start believing
there's something wonderful in you
you're at the age of not believing
and worst of all you doubt yourself
you're a castaway where no one hears you
on a barren isle in a lonely sea
where did all the happy endings go?
where can all the good times be?

doubting everything you ever knew
until at last you start believing

de hele hal heeft nu al veel meer kleur
enkijk,we hebben zelfseen feestservies!
te lang was dit 'nlege hal
in onze balzaal, nooit 'n bal
eindelijk waait hier een frisse bries
en er komen echte mensen
da's even wennen misschien
maar wauw, wat heb ik daar naar uigezien!
want voor het eerst na al die jaren
klinkt hier straks weer feestgezang
voor het eerst na al die jaren
zal ik dansen, urenlang
m'n maag speelt wat op van de zenuwen
maar daar kom ik wel overheen
want voor het eerst na al die jaren, ben ik niet alleen
ik kan niet wachten tot ik de gasten ontmoet
misschien ontmoet ik 'de ware' wel
en straks, ik denk zo rond zeven uur
sta ik bevallig bij de muur
een toonbeeld van verfijning, oelala
en plotseling zie ik hem dan staan
een prachtige prins, hij lacht spontaan
van schrik stop ik me mond vol chocola
maar hij blijft gezellig praten
en hij lacht om wat ik doe
hoe anders was mijn leven to nu toe
voor het eerst na al die jaren
krijgt de dag een gouden rand
voor het eerst na al die jaren
kan iemand vragen om mijn hand
en oke, in het echt gaat het anders
dan in kasteelromans
maar voor het eerst na al die jaren
maak ik nu echt een kans
laat niemand toe, spreek niemand aan
wees gehoorzaam, en ga hier niet vandaan
voel niets, doe niets
dat iets verraad
want een verkeerde stap
en 't is te laat
gelukkig duurt 't maar 'n dag al duurt 't maar een dag!
alleen omdat het hoort dit is zoals het hoort!
goed dan, wachter, open nu de poort
voor het eerst na al die jaren
laat niemand toe, spreek niemand aan
zal ik weer nieuwe mensen zien
wees gehoorzaam en ga hier niet vandaan
ik hoop op nieuw geluksgevoel
zeg niets
en liefde zelfs, misschien
voel niets
doe niets dat iets verraadt
maar morgen zal alles voorbij zijn
dus vandaag 't is wat ik zeg
ja voor het eerst na al die jaren
voor het eerst na al die jaren
staat niets mij in de weg o meu corpo inteiro treme
mas não é o frio
e eu me sinto à beira
de umsonhoque sempre mefugiu
sigo a te escutar
como a vozque eu tanto ouvi
e parece
que eu sempre estive aqui
todos acham que eu sou forte
só quis me proteger
quero aprender
a ser igual você
vem mostrar
qual é a verdade

sempre fui a esquisita
nunca soube a razão
talvez você me ajude a ver
qual é a explicação?
vem mostrar
já não tenho medo
nunca fui tão longe assim
sei que você é a chave pra eu me conhecer
vem me mostrar
apareça pra mim
quero te ver
me deixe entrar
eu me cansei de esperar
eu quero te ver

and you'll still make the whole day through
you can be a champion too
if you eat kanine krunchies! genie: i parachuted down into the taj mahal
i roller-bladed all along the great great wall!
i even made the famous leaning tower fall
but who was with me through it all?
nobody!
the moscow circus hired me to fly trapeze
on mount olympus won a race with hercules
it's easy when you're chased by killer bees
who said "gesundheit" when i sneezed?
ah choo!
so now i'm home
home again with you
you chase the clouds away
whenever i am blue
and the pyramids i highly recommend
there is nothing in the world quite like a friend
slept like a babe in bombay on a bed of nails
moroccans loved my daring dance of seven veils
why, single-handedly i even saved the whales
no one was there to hear my tales! crying
in acapulco joined a mariachi band
i rode the ragin' rapids down the rio grande
flew in an air balloon, but when i tried to land
nobody laughed, or lent a hand
without you, the amazon is just a trickle
without you, the sahara's not so hot
without you, niagara falls is just a leaky faucet
and the qeii is just some yacht
now that i'm home
home again, it's clear
all i ever wanted
seems to be right here
i've traveled east and west
and now, i'm back again
and there's nothing in the world quite like a friend
aladdin: there's nothing in the world
jasmine: nothing in the whole wide world
all: there is nothing in the world quite like a friend
genie: nothin' in the whole wide world whistle, my love
and i will come to thee
i'll always find you
no matter where you may be
whistle, my love
i'll hear you calling me
high on a hilltop
or under the greenwood tree
whistle a song i sang to you
when our love was gay
and every woodland breeze that blows
will bring it my way
whistle, my love
and i will come to thee
i'll always find you
no matter where you may be
i'll always find you
no matter where you may be

it's swinging and it's swaying a little rhapsody
today we're so delighted
today we're all united
here on the land and sea
i think the sails are sailing
even the whales are wailing
they're swimming fancy-free
we're feeling better now
we sing together now
here on the land and sea
la-dee-da
we got the beat
move your fins
and move your feet
life is sweet
life is grand
blowing bubbles
with the bass brass band
everybody now!
there's no more stormy weather
now we can sing together
in perfect harmony
we're feeling better now
we sing together now
here on the land and sea
those on land sing...
lucky-dah-do
those below sing
do-dee-do-do
life is sweet as sweet can be
on the land and on the sea
everybody sing!
la-da-da-da-da-da
la-da-da-da-da-da
la-da-da-da-dee-dee
we're feeling better now
we sing together now
here on the land and sea
la-da-da-da-da-da
la-da-da-da-da-da
la-da-da-da-dee-dee
we're feeling better now
we sing together now
here on the land and sea!the sky is perfectly blue
the clouds are perfect too
and here i am with you
what could be more right?
our quest has come to an end
and home's around the bend
and here you are, my friend
what could be more right?
nothing can go wrong
if everything is right
and everything is right somehow
nothing can go wrong
as long as everything is right
and everything is right, right now
bees are buzzing around
we're on familiar ground
and look at who we've found
what could be more right?
nothing can go wrong
if everything is right
and everything is right somehow
nothing can go wrong
as long as everything is right
and everything is right
top to bottom
everything is right
thank goodness, you got him
everything is right
perfectly, wonderfully, totally
silly old bear
right now

if i never knew you
if i never felt this love
i would have no inkling of
how precious life can be
if i never held you
i would never have a clue
how at last i find in you
the missing part of me
in this world so full of fear
full of rage and lies
i can see the truth so clear
in your eyes, so dry your eyes
and i'm so grateful to you
i'd have lived my whole life through
lost forever
if i never knew you
i thought our love would be so beautiful
somehow we'd make the whole world bright
i never knew that fear and hate could be so strong
all they leaved us were these whispers in the night
but still my heart is saying we were right
for-
-if i never knew you there's no moment i regret
if i never felt this love since the moment that we met
i would have no inkling of if our time has gone to past
how precious life can be i'd lived at last
and i'm so grateful to you
i'd have lived my whole life through
empty as the sky
never knowing why
lost forever
if i never knew you heather headley: in a perfect world
one we've never known
we would never need to face the world alone
they can have the world
we'll create our own
i may not be brave or strong or smart
but somewhere in my secret heart
i know
love will find a way
anywhere i go
i'm home
if you are there beside me
like dark turning into day
somehow we'll come through
now that i've found you
love will find a way
kenny lattimore: i was so afraid
now i realize
love is never wrong
and so it never dies
there's a perfect world
shining in your eyes
both: and if only they could feel it too
the happiness i feel with you
they'd know
love will find a way
anywhere we go
we're home
if we are there together
like dark turning into day
somehow we'll come through
now that i've found you
love will find a way
i know love will find a way love is a song that never ends
life may be swift and fleeting
hope may die yet love's beautiful music
comes each day like the dawn
love is a song that never ends
one simple theme repeating
like the voice of a heavenly choir
love's sweet music flows on
like the voice of a heavenly choir
love's sweet music flows on there's a calm surrender
to the rush of day
when the heat of the rolling world
can be turned away
an enchanted moment
and it sees me through
it's enough for this restless warrior
just to be with you
and can you feel the love tonight?
the peace the evening brings
the world for once in perfect harmony
with all its living things
and can you feel the love tonight?
you needn't look too far
stealing through the night's uncertainties
love is where we are
the world for once in perfect harmony
with all its living things

the world in perfect harmony with all its living things. that, my friends, is a time for joyous celebration. for when all things exist in balance it is then we're all connected in the great circle: the circle of life
from the day we arrive on the planet
and blinking step into the sun
there's more to see than can ever be seen
more to do than can be ever be done
there's far too much to take in here
more to find than can ever be found
but the sun rolling high through the sapphire sky
keeps great and small on the endless round
it's the circle of life
and it moves us all
through despair and hope
through faith and love

you won't forget katrina
but nobody yet has ever upset katrina
that cute coquette katrina
you can do more with margaret or helena
or ann or angelina

to her a romance is fun
with always another one to start
and then when you've met that little coquette katrina
you've lost your heart instrumental 0:00-1:06
one gift, beauty rare
golden sunshine in her hair
lips that shade the red, red rose

melody your whole life long
the nightingale her troubadour
bringing his sweet serenade to
her door

ce lac de neige cache un trésor très précieux, qu'il faut mériter

magnifique! fantastique! dangereux! froid!
la nature reprend toujours ses droits!
plus fort que moi, plus fort que nous, la glace est plus fort que tout!

quando eu era um filhote
— é, foi bom isso, hein?
— obrigado!
sentiu que seu cheiro era de um porcalhão
esvaziava a savana depois da refeição
era só eu chegar e era um tormento
quando via todo mundo sentar contra o vento
ai, que vexame!
era um vexame
quis mudar meu nome!
— ah, que que tem o nome?

from her prissy pink nose
to her custard complexion
and eleven pink toes
with a chin like a prune
she's a dainty baboon-
-and she thinks she's the pink of perfection
she's the pink of perfection
made of skim milk and rice
she's a witch's confection
makes your blood turn to ice
like a stale charlatreuse
with a charm of a moose-
-and she thinks she's the pink of perfection
never walked e'er a creature with features so fair
like a lillian russell-
-without any hair
she's a princess presiding
in diaphanous gown
with the face and a figure
that's the envy of clowns
she's a knock-kneed gazelle-
-with the voice of a bell
and she thinks she's the pink of perfection i'm the guy they call little mickey mouse
got a sweetie down in the chicken house
neither fat nor skinny
she's the horse's whinny
she's my little minnie mouse!
when it's feedin' time for the animals
and they howl and growl like the cannibals
i just turn my heel to the henhouse steal
and you'll hear me sing this song
oh, the old tomcat with his meow, meow, meow!
ol' hound dog his the bow-wow-wow!
the crow's caw-caw!
and the mule's hee-haw!
gosh what a racket like an ol' buzz saw!

and i've heard the rooster cock his doodle doo-oo
with the cows and the chickens
they all sound like the dickens
when i hear my little minnie "yoo-hoo"!

the young man said
and your hair has become very white
and yet you incessantly stand on your head
do you think, at your age
it is right, is right
do you think at your age it is right
"well, in me youth,"
father william replied to his son
i'd do it again and again... oh maman, je n'ai pas le temps de danser
j'ai encore de longues choses à faire
je n'ai pas le temps de perdre mon temps
y'a plus urgent sur terre
cette ville est trop tranquille
la vie s'écoule lentement
je sais où je vais depuis si longtemps
et j'irai toujours, toujours de l'avant
j'irai au bout du rêve
au bout du rêve
si je rencontre des montagnes
je les soulève
si je tombe, il suffit que je me relève
alors rien ne pourra m'arrêter
j'irai au bout du rêve
et comme le disait mon père
"tu réussiras un jour
n'épargne pas tes efforts
fais-le avec amour"
alors chaque matin je me mets au travail
et je vais gagner cette bataille
c'est bientôt le grand jour
c'est à moi, oui, c'est mon tour
j'irai au bout du rêve
au bout du rêve
et pour ça je travaillerai sans trêve
j'irai au bout du rêve
au bout du rêve
comme tout le monde, j'ai fait des erreurs
je ne suis pas parfaite
mais j'atteins le sommet
je sais qu'un jour
j'irai au bout du rêve
au bout du rêve
au bout de mon rêve three creaky wooden stairs
those squeaky rocking chairs
the well worn welcome mat
the lattice vines, the happy times
all i wanna do when the day is through
is linger here on the front porch with you
from the wicker swing, while the night birds sing
we'll watch the fireflies sparkin, do some sparkin to
how the hours fly, as the moon drifts by
how sweet the air as we stare at the sun
oh how i'd love to linger here like this
hold your hand and steal a kiss or two on the front porch with you
all i wanna do, when the day is through
is linger here on the front porch with you
on the worker swing, as the night birds sing
we'll watch the fireflies sparking do some sparking too
how the hours fly, as the moon drifts by
how sweet the air, as we stare at the sun
oh how i love to linger here like this
hold your hand and steal a kiss or two

the little old bird lady comes
in her own special way to the people she calls
"come, buy my bags full of crumbs
come feed the little birds, show them you care
and you'll be glad if you do
their young ones are hungry
their nests are so bare;
all it takes is tuppence from you."
feed the birds, tuppence a bag
tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag
"feed the birds," that's what she cries
while overhead, her birds fill the skies
all around the cathedral the saints and apostles
look down as she sells her wares
although you can't see it, you know they are smiling
each time someone shows that he cares
though her words are simple and few
listen, listen, she's calling to you:
"feed the birds, tuppence a bag
tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag." ah-ah, ah-ah
ah-ah, ah-ah
i can hear you, but i won’t
some look for trouble, while others don’t

are routine ev'ry hour or so
where enchantment runs rampant
gets wild in the streets
open sesame and here we go
arabian nights
like arabian days
they tease and excite
take off and take flight
they shock and amaze
arabian nights
like arabian days
more often than not
are hotter than hot
in a lot of good ways
pack your shield, pack your sword
you won't ever get bored
though get beaten or gored you might
come on down, stop on by
hop a carpet and fly
to another arabian night  *lyrics to be updated soon!*
attention cadets, are you ready for a day of action, achievement, and adventure? well, as a member of the universe protection unit of the space ranger core, you must be alert at all times and prepare for any eventuality. it's a dynamic and exciting lifestyle, but it's also a responsibility. someone has to protect the universe from evil. if you're prepared to blast out of this world, face emperor zurg, and those like him, then someday, someone may write a song like this about you, too
it took a real space toy to change the way things are
it took a real space toy from a far off star
his laser ray is on his hand
he leads the way for the star command
all this buzz is cause of a real space toy
it took a hero toy to fight the evil zurg
it took a real cool toy, as cool as an iceberg
he stands up for what's good and true
and to infinity he flew
beyond a friend to you, he's a hero toy

well we know that buzz is a friend because he will stick with you when nobody does
and will bring you home when you lost your way, and
 light the night with his laser ray
with his laser
ray
it took a real starship to bring us buzz lightyear
it was a real long trip, to get from there to here
and though we may be full of doubt
buzz is there to help out
it's what he's all about, he's a real space toy
he's gonna shake it up, he's gonna really zoom
he's gonna rocket through that 
watch your head, cause vroom, he's a real space toy
watch him go, vroom he's a real space, vroom he's a real space, vroom he's a real space, vroom he's a real space, vroom he's a real space toy
now that, future space rangers, is some terrific songwriting, but enough about me. i can see that you aren't quite ready to blast off yet. so let me tell you about the first time i met our little three-eyed alien friends here. all they did was wait around for something called "the claw", then decide if they would stay or go. i said, "i come in peace", or maybe, "carpe diem. seize the day", or something like that. whatever it was, i remember i made quite an impression on them, although, maybe it was just the uniform. soon after, they asked for my help, and sang this song phil harris and sebastian cabot
look for the bare necessities
the simple bare necessities
forget about your worries and your strife
i mean the bare necessities
old mother nature's recipes
with just the bare necessities of life are we on our way to nottingham, to brittingham, to buckingham
or any hammy hamlet by the sea? no
are we on our way to devonshire, to lancashire or worchestershire?
i'm not so sure
we'll have to wait and see
oh, are we on our way to dover
or going merrily over
the jolly old road that goes to plymouth? ho, no
we're merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily on our way
to nowhere in particular
we're merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily on our way
where the roads are perpendicular
we're always in a hurry
we have no time to stall
we've got to be there
we've got to be there
but where, we can't recall
we're merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily on our way
and we may be going to devonshire, to lancashire or worchestershire
we're not so sure but what do we care?
we're only sure we've got to be there
we're merrily on our way to nowhere at all  once a lonely caterpillar sat and cried
to a sympathetic beetle by his side
"i've got nobody to hug
i'm such an ugly bug."
then a spider and a dragon fly replied
"if you're serious and want to win a bride
come along with us
to the glorious
annual ugly bug ball."
come on let's crawl
gotta crawl, gotta crawl
to the ugly bug ball
to the ball, to the ball
and a happy time we'll have there
one and all
at the ugly bug ball
while the crickets clicked their tricky melodies
all the ants were fancy-dancing with the fleas
then up from under the ground
the worms came squirming around
oh they danced until there legs were nearly lame
every little crawling creature you could name
everyone was glad
what a time they had
they were so happy they came
everyone was glad! what a time they had!
they were so happy they came!
come on let's crawl
gotta crawl, gotta crawl
to the ugly bug ball
to the ball, to the ball
and a happy time we'll have there
one and all!
at the ugly bug ball
then our caterpillar saw a pretty queen
she was beautiful in yellow, black and green
he said, "would you care to dance?"
their dancing led to romance
and she sat upon his caterpillar knees
and he gave his caterpillar queen a squeeze
soon they'll honeymoon
build a big cocoon
thanks to the ugly bug ball
come on let's crawl
gotta crawl, gotta crawl
to the ugly bug ball
to the ball, to the ball
and a happy time we'll have there
one and all!
at the ugly bug ball! hakuna matata

ce reve bleu
c'est un nouveau monde en couleurs
où personne ne nous dit
c'est interdit
de croire encore au bonheur
ce reve bleu
je n'y crois pas, c'est merveilleux
pour moi, c'est fabuleux
quand dans les cieux
nous partageons ce reve bleu, à deux
nous faisons ce reve bleu à deux
sous le ciel de cristal
je me sens si légère
je vire, délire et chavire
dans un océan d'étoiles
ce reve bleu ...
ne ferme pas les yeux !
c'est un voyage fabuleux ...
et contemple ces merveilles !
je suis montée trop haut
allée trop loin
je ne peux plus retourner d'où je viens
un reve bleu ...
sur les chevaux du vent ...
vers les horizons du bonheur ...
dans la poussière d'étoiles ...
naviguons dans le temps
infiniment
et vivons ce reve merveilleux !
ce reve bleu ...
ce reve bleu ...
aux mille nuits ...
aux mille nuits ...
qui durera ...

-papa t'a coupé les vivres, hein playboy? ... faut qu'tu t'mettes la bague au doigt, mais sans t'passer la corde au cou. tu veux être libre comme l'air? bondir de ville en ville? mais pour être libre, faut des billets verts...

pour toi mon petit, le bilan sera vite fait
tu as toujours été exploité
exploité par ta petit' mère
ta petit' soeur, ton petit frère

ta petit' femme t'exploiterai
mais en me plongeant dans ton av'nir
je vois seul'ment, l'homme que tu as rêvé de de'vnir
-serrez-moi la main... mes chers amis, serrez la main d'un pauvre pêcheur... oui...

pulo do tigrão how pleasant, bobbing along
bobbing along on the bottom of the beautiful briny sea
what a chance to get a better peep
at the plants and creatures of the deep
we glide
far below the rolling tide
serene
through the bubbly blue and green
it's lovely, bobbing along
bobbing along on the bottom of the beautiful briny sea
what if the octopus, the flounder, and the cod
think we're rather odd
it's fun to promenade
bobbing along, singing a song
on the bottom of the beautiful briny sea
it's lovely, bobbing along
bobbing along on the bottom of the beautiful briny sea
what a chance to get a better peep
at the plants and creatures of the deep
it's grand
when you're dancing on the sand
each glance
bubbles over with romance
it's lovely, bobbing along
bobbing along through the water where we get along swimmingly!
far from the frenzy
of the frantic world above
two beneath the blue
could even fall in love
bobbing along, singing a song
on the bottom of the beautiful briny sea
bobbing along, singing a song
on the bottom of the beautiful briny
shimmering shiny
beautiful briny sea! veja o que acontece
— o quê?!
o que virá depois
— o quê?!
estes pombinhos vão se apaixonar, seremos só nós dois
— ah!
a troca de carícias
a mágica no ar
enquanto há romance entre os dois, desastres vão chegar!
nesta noite o amor chegou
chegou pra ficar
e tudo está em harmonia e paz
romance está no ar
são tantas coisas a dizer
mas como lhe explicar
o que me aconteceu?
não vou contar, se não vai me deixar
o que é que ele esconde
e não quer revelar?
pois dentro dele um rei existe
mas que não quer mostrar!
nesta noite o amor chegou
chegou para ficar
e tudo está em harmonia e paz
romance está no ar
nesta noite o amor chegou
e bem neste lugar
para os dois cansados de esperar
para se encontrar
final feliz escrito está
que má situação
sua liberdade está quase no fim
domado está o leão! percusión

ella está ahí
a tu lado y tu la ves
va callada pero crees

no hacen falta palabras
calla dejalo no digas nada, no

essas coisas humanas são úteis
mas pra mim são bonitas demais
para o povo do mar, são inúteis
mas pra mim ainda é pouco
quero mais
eu quero estar onde o povo está
eu quero ver um homem dançando
e passeando em seus...
como eles chamam? ah! pés!
com barbatanas não se vai longe
tem que ter pernas pra ir andando
ou pra passear lá na... como é que eles chamam? rua
durante a noite, durante o dia
lá eles andam com alegria
tudo eu faria
eu só queria
ser desse mundo
o que eu daria pela magia de ser humana
eu pagaria por um só dia poder viver
com aquela gente conviver
e ficar fora dessas águas
eu desejo
eu almejo este prazer
eu quero saber o que eles sabem
fazer perguntas e ouvir respostas
o que é o fogo?
o que é queimar?
será que eu posso ver?
quero saber, quero morar
naquele mundo cheio de ar
quero viver
não quero ser
mais deste mar all you need

whenyou flock together
with your family

every family
is special and unique
and all you need to make it complete
it's l-o-v-e, love i bring you a song
and i sing as i go
for i want you to know
that i'm looking for romance
i bring you a song
in the hope that you'll see
when you're looking at me
that i'm looking for love
i'm seeking that glow
only found when you're young and it's may
only found on that wonderful day
when all longing is through
i'm seeking that glow
only found when a thrill is complete
only found when two hearts gently beat
to the strength of a waltz that's both tender and new
i bring you a song
for i'm seeking romance
you're by my side
there's a moon up above
it shines with a light that's so mellow and bright
it's easy to see
that tonight we shall fall in love
i bring you a song
for i'm seeking romance who would you choose?
who would it be?
who'd close their eyes with you
and who could still see?
and i know how you've dreamed about
how he'd be with you
so i think i'd be perfect for you
who'd light your way
but not cross your star?
who'd call in his brigade
but not fight your war?
and if you needed time alone
i'd know what to do
and i think i'd be perfect for you
i think i'd do fun
i think i'd do right
i think i could walk with you
through the shadows of your nights
and if you think that i am just one who would do
no, i think i'd be perfect for you
i think i'd be perfect for you o presente já já é passado
e envelheço ao seu lado
essa brisa vai soprar as nuvensparatrás
hoje a abóboravoltou para a terra
essa folha numinstante já era
mas eu sei que certas coisas são iguais
e nada vai mudar
como eu pego na sua mão
isso vai durar
você mora em meu coração
como um muro antigo que segue em pé
somos eu e você
nada vai mudar
e eu prometo não te perder
eu vejo as folhas caindo
parece até que o futuro vem vindo
não me diga que essa noite você vai se ajoelhar
eu nunca fui um mestre em planejamento
e quase sempre estrago o momento
e que tal deixar o seu amigo te ajudar?
é, nada vai mudar
o que ela me faz sentir
eu não vou negar
com você eu sei como agir
mas se eu tentar
e me arriscar
eu faço acontecer, né?
nada vai mudar
o meu futuro tá com você
o vento urge
a voz parece me atrair
estou confusa
mas quero a vida que eu tenho aqui
eu tenho amigos
não quero mais partir
não congelo o tempo
mas eu ainda sei me divertir
o presente já já é passado
e você envelhece ao meu lado
nós somos tão felizes vivendo em arendelle
é uma terra de muita fartura
e nós devolvemos à altura
a bandeira de arendelle pra sempre irá nos orgulhar!
irá nos orgulhar!
irá nos orgulhar!
nada vai mudar
não importa o que acontecer
e o que virá
é o futuro que vai dizer
o que já passou
e nos transformou
não vamos esquecer
nada vai mudar
e eu prometo não te perder
prometo não te perder
eu não vou te perder
eu não vou te perder
prometo não te perder para obtener lo que quieres
deberás convertirte en humano
ohhh y usted podría hacerlo?
pero pequeña y dulce niña
eso hago, para eso vivo
para ayudar almas en infortunio
como la tuya
sola triste y sin tener con quien contar
yo admito que solía ser muy mala
no bromeaban al decir que bruja soy
pero ahora encontraras
que mi camino enmendé
que firmemente arrepentida estoy
cierto es
por fortuna conozco algo de magia
un talento que yo siempre poseí
y últimamente no te rías
lo uso en favor
de miserables que sufren depresión
patético
pobres almas en desgracia
que sufren necesidad
esta quiere ser delgada
y este quiere una pareja
quien los ayudo, yo lo hice
pobres almas en desgracia
tan tristes, tan solas
vienen rogando a mi caldera
implorando mis hechizos
quien les ayudo, lo hice yo
un par de veces ha pasado
que el precio no han pagado
y tuve que sus cuerpos disolver
todos se han quejado
pero la santa me han llamado
estas pobres almas en desgracia
aceptas querida
si me convierto en humana
ya no veré a mi padre
ni a mis hermanas
pero tendrás a tu hombre rizas
es difícil decidir en la vida
no crees ariel rizas
ohhh y además hay otro
pequeño detalle
no hemos hablado de cómo me pagaras
no se puede recibir sin dar nada a cambio
pero yo no tengo nada que…
no es mucho lo que pido
lo que quiero es tu voz
pero sin mi voz como
eso no importa te vez muy bien
no olvides que tan solo tu belleza
es más que suficiente jaaaaa
los hombres no te buscas si les hablas
no creo que los quieras aburrir
allá arriba es preferido
que las damas no conversen
a no ser que no te quieras divertir
veras que no logras nada conversando
a menos que los pienses ahuyentar
admirada tu serás si callada siempre estas
sujeta bien tu lengua y triunfaras ariel!
pobre alma en desgracia
que harás
piensa ya
no me queda mucho tiempo
ocupada voy a estar
y solamente es tu voz
pobre alma en desgracia
que haré por ti
si tú quieres ser feliz
entonces tienes que pagar
no te vas a arrepentir
no dudes más y firma ya
que sencillo fue
que tonta es
muy pronto salvare
a esta pobre alma de aquel les poissons, les poissons

i pull out what's inside
and i serve it up fried
god, i love little fishes, don't you?
here's something for tempting the palate
prepared in the classic technique
first you pound the fish flat with a mallet
then you slash through the skin
gives the belly a slice
then you rub some salt in
'cause that makes it taste nice
zut alors, i have missed one
sacre bleu, what is this?
how on earth could i miss
such a sweet little succulent crab?
quel dommage, what a loss
here we go in the sauce
now some flour, i think just a dab

and you're certainly lucky, you are
'cause it's gonna be hot
in my big silver pot

le rapport du matin mr. banks:
with tuppence for paper and strings
you can have your own set of wings

with your fist holding tight
to the string of your kite

up to the highest height!
let's go fly a kite and send it soaring
up through the atmosphere
up where the air is clear
oh, let's go fly a kite!
when you send it flyin' up there
all at once you're lighter than air
you can dance on the breeze
over 'ouses and trees
with your first 'olding tight
to the string of your kite

celebrate, celebrate
come on now, everyone  a map is not a guess
an estimation or a hunch
a feeling or a foolish intuition
a map is a dependable
unwavering, inarguably accurate
portrayer, of your position
never trust your ears
your nose, your eyes
putting faith in them
is most unwise
here's a phrase you all
must memorise
in the printed word
is where truth lies
never trust your tummies
tails, or toes
you can't learn a thing
from any of those
here's another fact
i must disclose
from the mighty pen
true wisdom flows
if it says so
then it is so
if it is so
well so it is
a thought's not fit to think
'til it's printed in ink
then it says so
so it is
never trust that thing
between your ears
brains will get you nowhere fast
my dears
haven't had a need
for mine in years
on the page is where
the truth appears
if it says so
then it is so
if it is so
so it is
a thought's not fit to think
'til it's printed in ink
never differ from or doubt it
or go anywhere without it
thank goodness we've got this
so we don't need to fret about it
if it says so
so it is eres tú el príncipe azul que yo soñé
eres tú, tus ojos me vieron con ternuras de amor
y al mirarme así, el fuego encendido mi corazón
y mi ensoñación se hará realidad
y te adorare como aconteció en mi sueño ideal

y mi ensoñación se hará realidad
y te adorare como aconteció en mi sueño ideal
eres tu el dulce ideal que yo soñé
eres tu, tus ojos me vieron con ternuras de amor
al mirarte así, el fuego encendió mi corazón
y mi ensoñación se hará realidad
y te adorare
como aconteció en mi sueño ideal oh, we'll smoke the blighter out
we'll put the beast to route
some kindling, a stick or two
ah, this bit of rubbish ought to do
we'll smoke the blighter out
we'll smoke the monster out
oh, we'll roast the blighter's toes
we'll toast the bounder's nose
just fetch that gate
we'll make it clear
that monsters aren't welcome here
without a single doubt
we'll smoke the monster out
we'll smoke the monster out miley
nobody listens to me
don't hear a single thing i've said
say anything to soothe me
anything to get you from my head
don't know how i really feel
the faith it takes to make like i don't care
don't know how much it hurts
to turn around like you were never there
like somehow you could be replaced
and i could walk away from the promises we made
and swore we'd never break
miley and travolta chorus
i thought i lost you when you ran away to try to find me
i thought i'd never see your sweet face again
i turned around and you were gone and on and on the days went
but i kept the moments that we were in
'cause i hoped in my heart you'd come back to me, my friend
and now i got you, but i thought i lost you
travolta
i felt so empty out there
and there were days i had my doubts
but i knew i'd find you somewhere
because i knew i couldn't live without
you in my life for one more day
and i swore i'd never break those promises we made
miley and travolta chorus
i thought i lost you when you ran away to try to find me
i thought i'd never see your sweet face again
i turned around and you were gone and on and on the days went
but i kept the moments that we were in
'cause i hoped in my heart you'd come back to me, my friend
and now i got you, but i thought i lost you
travolta
i told myself i wouldn't sleep 'till i searched the world from sea to sea
miley
i made a wish upon a star, i turned around and there you were
miley and travolta
now here we are, are
miley
here we are
i thought i lost you
travolta
i thought i lost you, too
miley
i thought i lost you
travolta
i thought i lost you
miley
yeah
miley and travolta chorus
i thought i lost you when you ran away to try to find me
i thought i'd never see your sweet face again
i turned around and you were gone and on and on the days went
but i kept the moments that we were in
and i knew in my heart you'd come back to me, my friend
and now i got you, but i thought i lost you
miley
but i thought i lost you
travolta
i thought i lost you, too
both
so glad i got you, got you
miley
so glad i got you, yeah yeah
i thought i lost you
travolta o fruto do meu vizinho
parece melhor que o meu
seu sonho de ir lá em cima
eu creio que é engano seu
você tem aqui no fundo
conforto até demais
é tão belo nosso mundo
o que é que você quer mais
onde eu nasci, onde eu cresci
é mais molhado, eu sou vidrado por tudo aqui
lá se trabalha o dia inteiro
lá são escravos do dinheiro
a vida é boa, eu vivo à toa, onde eu nasci
o peixe vive contente
aqui debaixo do mar
e o peixe que vai para terra
não sabe onde vai parar
às vezes vai pra um aquário
o que não é ruim de fato
mas quando o homem tem fome
o peixe vai para o prato não!
vou lhe contar, aqui no mar
ninguém nos segue, nem nos persegue
pra nos fritar
se os peixes querem ver o sol
tomem cuidado com o anzol
até o escuro é mais seguro aqui no mar
onde eu nasci, onde eu cresci
neste oceano, entra e sai ano
tem tudo aqui
os peixes param de nadar
quando é hora de tocar
temos a bossa que é toda nossa
aqui no mar
tritão sopra flauta e a carpa na harpa
a solha no baixo, melhor som não acho
e aqui nos metais tem peixe demais
espere que temos mais
ninguém toca mal, nem o bacalhau
a truta dançando e o preto cantando
e até o salmão vem para o salão
e olha quem vem soprar, ha ha
oii! ah ha!
aqui no mar, aqui no mar
até a sardinha entra na minha e vem cantar
e se eles têm montes de areia, nós temos coro de sereia
qualquer molusco, sempre que eu busco sabe tocar
até a lesminha sai da conchinha e vem dançar
caracolzinho tira um sonzinho
por isso gente daqui é quente
faz um programa, até na lama
aqui no mar do mi sol do do sol mi do
le vrai musicien répète avec ardeur
de savantes gammes et des arpèges
mais il faut qu'il sache que sa voix doit sortir du coeur
en chantant ses gammes et ses arpèges
si nous voulons chaque jour les pratiquer
nous verrons nos progrès vite encouragés
do mi sol mi do mi sol mi fa la do la do
répétons nos gammes et nos arpèges!
do mi sol do ...?
do mi sol do do sol mi do
do mi sol do do sol mi do
ce travail fastidieux qu'on fait sans effort
un beau jour pourra valoir son pesant d'or
et vous permettra de jouer de ravissants accords
apprenons nos gammes et nos arpèges sunny days and starry nights and lazy afternoons
you're counting castles in the clouds and humming little tunes
but somehow right before your eyes the summer fades away
everything is different and everything has changed
if you feel lost
and on your own
and far from home
you're never alone, you know
just think of your friends
the ones who care
they all will be waiting there
with love to share
and your heart will lead you home
funny how a photograph can take you back in time
to places and embraces that you thought you left behind
trying to remind you that you're not the only one
that no one is an island when all is said and done
there'll come a day when you're losing your way
and you won't know where you belong
they say that home is where the heart is
so follow your heart and know that you can't go wrong you must
walk feminine, talk feminine
smile and beguile feminine
utilise your femininity
that's what every girl should know
if she wants to catch a beau
dance feminine, glance feminine
act shy and sigh feminine
compliment his masculinity
that's what every girl should know
if she wants to catch a beau
let him do the talking
men enjoy good listeners
laugh but not loudly "ha, ha!"
if he should choose to tell a joke
be radiant
but delicate
memorize the rules of etiquette
be demure, sweet and pure
hide the real you
you must
look feminine, dress feminine
you're at your best feminine
emphasize your femininity
that's what every girl should know
femininity, femininity
that's the way to catch a beau instrumental doce visão
guardo em mim aquela emoção
eu te levo no coração
sempre estás comigo
quem me dera voltar
a ouvir teu doce cantar
não consigo me conformar
de não mais te abraçar
essa doce visão
talvez nunca mais volte então
guardo a emoção do tempo que foi
oh, vou cantar
contra a dor eu vou cantar
é só o feitiço
eu sempre insisto que o amor
revela o melhor
como manter a confiança
em meio à dor e a escuridão?
já fui cheia de certezas
só restou suposição
tempos atrás
largo enfim a minha infância ah, eu fui tão feliz
pai, não segure a minha mão nunca mais
eu percebo que cresci oh, só me abrace!
o meu destino eu vou seguir
essa visão
vai voltar a ser real
vai ser assim
e todos irão renascer enfim que foi isso?
que foi isso?
que foi isso?
que foi isso?
oh gente! que foi isso?
rápido que a hiena já vem

nós cavamos túneis sem parar
nossa vida é só cavar
nós cantamos essa canção
prosseguindo a escavação
construímos o nosso lar
com a lama pra reforçar
e terminamos com rapidez
aleluia, vamos outra vez!

o que foi isso?
rápido que a hiena já vem ce que je préfère dans les rivières
c'est que printemps, été ou hiver
elles changent toujours d'humeur et de couleur
mais combien de cœurs dans la nature
ont rêvé d'aventure
en laissant fuir les années, sans se demander:
au détour de la rivière
sera-t-il au détour de la rivière?
bravant les flots!
ce voyageur de la mer
sur son bateau
et toujours je crois
toujours j'espère
que cet inconnu viendra
au détour de la rivière...
pour moi, rien que pour moi...
en badinant, le vent ballade
des torrents de rires en cascade
les tambours nuit et jour
résonnent d'amour
mais celui que je voudrais choisir
pour construire l'avenir
viendra-t-il de la terre
ou du bleu des mers?
au détour de la rivière
au détour de la rivière
j'attends, j'espère
qu'au détour de la rivière
il sera là
venant de la mer
rien que pour moi
dans un rêve de lumière
au détour de la rivière!
au détour de la rivière!
faut-il éteindre la flamme
dans le lit d'un fleuve calme
en épousant kokoum
pour ne plus rêver à cet homme?
je voudrais tant m'évader, voyageur
sur la rivière de ton coeur! so bene cosa provi per me
trovarsi faccia a faccia ti è strano
e nemmeno tu sai come stai
è adorabile
gli umani sai non cambiano mai
apri i tuoi occhi che adesso iniziamo
sono il vero maui trattieni il fiato
forse per te è troppo, i capelli, il corpo
hai davanti un semi dio
che posso dirti a parte “prego”
il mare e il cielo sono merito mio
non c’è di che tutto ok prego
io sono solo un semi dio
che posso dirti a parte “prego”
il mare e il cielo sono merito mio
non c’è di che tutto ok prego
io sono solo un semi dio
e il sottoscritto che ha preso quel raggio di sole solo per scaldarti
ho preso le isole in acqua ma non ringraziarmi non c’è di che
ho allungato i giorni e gli umani nemmeno mi hanno detto grazie
senza di me forse la terra veniva colpita da mille disgrazie
i tatuaggi sul corpo sono la storia di quello che vedo
dovrei soltanto risponderti prego
per il mare la terra ed il cielo
dovrei soltanto risponderti prego
per le piante e le noci di cocco
dovrei soltanto risponderti prego
ma va, tutto apposto
che posso dirti a parte "prego"
per il mondo stupendo che hai
non c’è di che tutto ok prego
adesso penso proprio che andrò
oggi è il tuo giorno per dirmi prego
quella barca mi servirà
e salperò lontano prego
so far tutto tranne galleggiare
prego {cordy}
oh, miss cordelia drexel biddle
i thought i knew you well
but now, miss cordelia drexel biddle
i just can't tell
are you valentine candy or boxing gloves?
lately you seem very strange
what in the world's coming over you?
everything's starting to change
are you sonnets by shelley or rover boys?
once, any answer would do
why are you suddenly wondering
which kind of someone are you?
is a boy meant to spar with or gaze at a star with?
should you kiss him or blacken his eye?
now if he buys you roses, a right to the nose is
really quite not the proper reply
you're so lost in the middle up in-between
is your destiny canvas or crepe de chine?
will you someday be someone that somebody loves?
are you valentine candy or boxing gloves?
will you someday be someone that somebody loves?
are you valentine candy or boxing gloves? vraiment? t'es sûr que tu t'y connais en chaleur?
non! mais quelque fois j'ai plaisir à fermer les yeux
et à imaginer la vie d'un bonhomme de neige en été
les abeilles
les pissenlits et le soleil
l'heure pour moi de faire ce que la neige fait
en été
un verre dans la main
je m'allonge sur le sable fin
je commence à bronzer en douceur
en été
je sens une brise très légère
chasser le froid de l'hiver
je plonge et je nage, je goûte au plaisir
de ne rien faire
et j'ai hâte de revoir
mes amis en ce jour de gloire
imaginez comme la vie sera belle
en été!
da da... da doo!
a bah bah ba baba boo!
le chaud et le froid sont faits pour s'entendre
ils ont une âme pure et un cœur tendre!
rat dadat dadat dadat dadadadadoo!
il y a ceux qui aiment les feux de cheminée
mais, mettez-moi au soleil et je serai...
un homme comblé!
quand le temps s'assombrit je m'accroche à mes rêves
et là sous un soleil brûlant je me détends!
quand le ciel sera bleu
vous serez là tous les deux
pour vivre la grande aventure de la neige
en été!
je vais lui dire
il n'en est pas question
en été! {john lawless}

regarde la
douce et fragile à la fois
elle ne dit rien, elle se tait
mais ton coeur brule en secret
tu ne sais pas pourquoi
mais c'est plus fort que toi
t'aimerais bien l'embrasser
tu rêvais d'elle
tu l'attends depuis toujours
si c'est un roman d'amour, faut provoquer l'étincelle
et les mots crois-moi, pour ça il n'y en a pas
décide toi, embrasse-la
avec moi maintenant
chalalalalala my oh my
il est intimidé, il n'ose pas l'embrasser
chalalalalala si il est sage
ce serait vraiment dommage
adieu la fiancée...
prends lui la main
dans la douceur du lagon
décide-toi mon garçon et n'attend pas demain
elle ne dit pas un mot
elle ne dira pas un mot avant d'être
embrassée...
chalalalalala n'est pas peur
ne pense qu'au bonheur
vas-y oui, embrasse-la
chalalalalala n'hésite pas
tu sais que toi tu ne penses qu'à ça
chalalalalala c'est si bon
ecoute la chanson
décide-toi, embrasse-la
chalalalalala vas-y fait vite
ecoute la musique
embrasse-la, embrasse-la... — tá, eu posso dizer uma coisa louca?
— eu adoro loucura!
muitas portas se fecharam pra mim sem razão
de repente eu encontrei você
— eu estava pensando a mesma coisa, porque...
eu passei a vida procurando emoção
talvez esteja nas conversas ou se lambuzar de glacê
com você
com você tenho emoção
vejo a razão
não há nada igual a esse amor sentir
vejo uma porta abrir
vejo uma porta abrir
vejo uma porta abrir
com você
você
você
você
vejo uma porta abrir
é meio doido
o quê?
você finaliza meus...
...sanduíches
era o que eu ia dizer
não conheci ninguém com...
...meu jeito de pensar
juntos... outra vez
parece sincronizado
mas pode ser explicado
você
e eu
nós somos um par
diga adeus
diga adeus
para a dor que passou
o amor não vai deixar ela vir
vejo uma porta abrir
vejo uma porta abrir
tudo vai se expandir
com você
você
você
você
vejo uma porta abrir
— posso dizer uma coisa louca?
— quer casar comigo?
— posso dizer uma coisa mais louca ainda?
— sim! ik had ooit een droom
oh, ik ben een schurk met streken
doe frankenstein verbleken
sociaal ben ikdusniet bepaalt inorde
want ik duld geen tegenspraak, ben'n monster met een haak
toch was ik liever pianist geworden
dan zit ik op toneel en speel ik mozart
ik kietel dan de toetsen zonder schroom
crimineel mag je me noemen, mij niet schuwen maar juist roemen
danku!
ik heb van kinds af aan een grote droom
hij heeft een droom x2
ik ben prachtig ookal lijk ik op een gnoom
ja ik breek graag wel eens botten
maar laat met m'n droom niet spotten
als ieder anders mens heb ik een droom
ik heb putten in m'n wangen
m'n vel begint te hangen
ik heb zes tenen in m'n sok
ik heb geen neusje maar een gok
en toch wil ik verkering met een dame
zie je mij al met een beeldschoon lekker moppie
samen in een schuitje op de stroom
al ben ik een lelijk dieffie
ben geen vechter maar een lieffie
diep in m'n hart heb ik een zoete droom
ik heb een droom hij heeft een droom x2
ik schreeuw het van 't dak en uit de hoogste boom
ookal klinkt het dan bezopen
ik blijf wachten, ik blijf hopen
als ieder ander mens heb ik een droom
tor wilt graag een bloemenstal beginnen
gunther styling maakt je huis intiem
euri houdt van miem
twee-laag cakejes zijn subliem
beuker breit
kid steekt vast
patser heeft een poppenkast
en bot verzamelt eenhoorns, wat wel bij hem past
en hoe zit het met jou?
wat zeg je, ik?
wat is jouw droom?
nee nee nee, sorry mannen, ik zing niet
ach, mijn droom is maar figuurlijk
en niet zo avontuurlijk
een plek waar het altijd rustig en altijd lente
't is een eiland in de zon
waar ik zorgeloos leven kon
met om mij heen wel hele bergen centen
ik heb een droom zij heeft een droom x2
ik wil kijken naar de lampionen stroom
ik ben blij als nooit tevoren
dat ik weg ben uit die toren
o lieve mensen, ik heb ook een droom
zij heeft een droom, hij heeft een droom, beide een droom, ieder een droom
nee de appel valt dus niet ver van de boom
en wat een droom
noem ons aso, ziek, sadistisch en belachelijk optimistisch
toch diep van binnen hebben wij een droom
ik heb een droom x5
ja ik heb net als jij een mooie droom
ja! llega el enemigo, vamos a luchar
uah
me enviaron nenas, tal vez a jugar
hoy dais lástima, vais a aprender
pasión, deber, valor, virtud
pues yo ya lo logré, ahora tú...
la quietud del bosque y el ardor del sol
cuando los consigues, tuyo es el control
y aunque eres hoy patético
todo un hombre haré de tí
y serás el mejor para mí
no puedo ya ni respirar
despedidme de mi gente
y por qué falté a la escuela a entrenar
ya la veo renunciar
que no vaya a descubrirme
como desearía hoy saber nadar
con valor
seré mas raudo que un río bravo
con valor
tendré la fuerza de un gran tifón
con valor
con la energía del fuego ardiente
la luna sabrá guiar el corazón
vienen ya lo hunos y no hoy más que hablar
si haces lo que ordene te podrás salvar
no estás listo aún para luchar
sobras ya, te irás de aquí
no serás el mejor para mí
con valor
seré más raudo que un río bravo
con valor
tendré la fuerza de un gran tifón
con valor
con la energía del fuego ardiente
la luna sabrá guiar el corazón
con valor
seré más raudo que un río bravo
con valor
tendré la fuerza de un gran tifón
con valor
con la energía del fuego ardiente uah
la luna sabrá guiar el corazón uah percusión...
cuerdas...
viento...
letra...
ella esta ahí sentada frente a ti
no te ha dicho nada aún pero algo te atrae
sin saber porqué te mueres por tratar de darle un beso ya
si la quieres, si la quieres mírala
mírala y ya verás no hay que preguntarle
no hay que decir no hay nada que decir ahora bésala...
sha la la la la la
¿qué pasó? él no se atrevió y no la besará
sha la la la la la
¡qué horror! qué lástima me da ya que la perderá...
el momento es, en esta laguna azul
pero no esperes más: mañana no puedes
no ha dicho nada y no lo hará si no la besas ya...
sha la la la la la
no hay porqué temer, no va a comer, ahora: bésala
sha la la la la la
sin dudar no lo evites más: ahora bésala
sha la la la la la
por favor escucha la canción: ahora bésala
sha la la la la la
es mejor que te decidas ya: ahora bésala
bésala, bésala, bésala...
¡¡bésala!!! oh it really doesn't matter what i do
what i do
as long as i do it with a flair
what effect a little smoke is
what a dash of hocus pocus
and a scent of burning sulfur in the air
i am a fraud, a hoke, a charlatan, a joke
but they love me everywhere!
for it really doesn't matter
what i do, what i do
as long as i do it with a flair!
and it doesn't really matter what i say, what i say!
as long as i say it with a flair
first i rattle off a ready stock of gibberish and poppycock
and fix you with my best hypnotic stare!
with my moans and groans and soporific tones
they have cheered my everywhere
for it really doesn't matter what i say, what i say
i said it when i tell it with a seamless selabin
the magicians nursery rhyme
abra -
cadabra! you succumb to it every time!
wave a stick, and each trick, will mystify and disarm
in fact, to coin a fitting phrase, it works, like a charm
so it really doesn't matter what i brew, what i brew
as long as i brew it with a flair
though i've never cast a magic spell
i make the motions very well
my showmanship is far beyond compare
i'm a rogue, a rake, a mountebank, a fake
but i do what e'er i dare
for it really doesn't matter what i do, what i do
you buy my charms and poxes cause they come in fancy boxes
to improve your ugly daughter, i've a vial of colored water
and my magic incantations can be framed as decorations
though there's really nothing to it, and of course, you all see through it!
you love me cause i do it -
with a flair! olha, eu vou lhe mostrar
como é belo este mundo
já que nunca deixaram o seu coração mandar
eu lhe ensino a ver todo encanto e beleza
que há na natureza num tapete a voar
um mundo ideal
é um privilégio ver daqui
ninguém pra nos dizer o que fazer
até parece um sonho
um mundo ideal
um mundo que eu nunca vi
e agora eu posso ver e lhe dizer
estou num mundo novo com você
e eu num mundo novo com você
uma incrível visão neste voo tão lindo
vou planando e subindo para o imenso azul do céu
um mundo ideal feito só pra você
nunca senti tanta emoção pois então aproveite
mas como é bom voar, viver no ar
eu nunca mais vou desejar voltar um mundo ideal
com tão lindas surpresas
com novos rumos pra seguir tanta coisa empolgante
aqui é bom viver
só tem prazer
com você não saio mais daqui
um mundo ideal
um mundo ideal
que alguém nos deu
que alguém nos deu
feito pra nós
somente nós
só seu e meu je vais t'offrir un monde
aux mille et une splendeurs
où les princesses au jardin
du bonheur offrent leur coeur
je vais ouvrir tes yeux
aux délices et aux merveilles
de ce voyage en plein ciel
au pays du reve bleu
ce rêve bleu
c'est un nouveau monde en couleurs
une nouvelle vie
un paradis aux mille nuits sans sommeil
ce rêve bleu
je n'y crois pas c'est merveilleux
un monde fabuleux est dans les cieux
et nous faisons ce rêve bleu à deux
sous le ciel de cristal
je me sens si légère
je vire délire et chavire dans un océan d'étoiles
ce rêve bleu
ne ferme pas les yeux
c'est un voyage fabuleux
tu verras des merveilles
seul dans la nuit des temps
au firmament
brûlons à deux ces mille et une nuits
ce rêve bleu
c'est partager nos deux printemps
sur un tapis volant
comme deux enfants
innocents
qui découvrent l'amour
mon rêve bleu
ton rêve bleu
c'est un nouveau monde en couleurs
une nouvelle vie
un paradis
aux mille nuits sans sommeil
ce rêve bleu
sous le ciel de cristal
c'est un univers de bonheur
dans la poussière d'étoiles
se prendre pour des dieux
c'est prodigieux
etre heureux
c'est merveilleux
vivre a deux
ce rêve bleu
d'amour
mon rêve bleu
ton rêve bleu
aux mille nuits
de paradis
il durera
pour toi et moi
toute la vie oh, i'll sing you a song, a rollicky song
as i roll along my way
with a "hey dery die" and a "derry die do"
and a "riddle de diddle de day"
hark to the tale of robin hood
and of his merrie men
whose like you are not like to see
in all the world again
his bow was long, his arm was strong
and his heart was good and true
well did he fight to gain the right
and so i pray may you angel in disguise
stories in his eyes
love for every true heart that he sees
was it just a lucky day
that he turned to look my way
or is it heaven right before my very eyes
he showed me all new things
the shimmer of moonbeams
i was blind but now he's helped me see
i was lost but now i'm found
his happiness surrounds
and now i've found that my dreams can come true
cause i'm gonna love you
for the rest of my life
i'm holding you safe here
in this heart of mine
i can't live without you
cause my soul would die
and i'm tellin' the truth
i'll spend the rest of my life loving you
it didn't start this way
it happened just one day
you smiled at me and i saw you differently
now i would tremble just to be
a part of you as we
begin a life that's sure to never end
cause i'm gonna love you
for the rest of my life
i'm holding you safe here
in this heart of mine
i can't live without you
cause my soul would die
and i'm tellin' the truth

'cause when it comes to this
i've got you beat
pretty good, huh?

in the sleepy town we come from
there's a steady beat that plays
might be just a little humtrum
so i'd like to learn its ways
it's in fire and in water
in the houses and the well
it's in every son and daughter
in the top and the bells
i've got you beat

how 'bout this?
hmm, not bad, not bad...
in the jungle there is freedom
yes, i'm sure that i've been told
no one drums the way that we drum
though it's fairly uncontrolled
there's this grouchy old piranha
who knows all the hippest tunes
once a shiny green iguana
show me how to play the spoons
i've got you beat
you do?
with a solo that always wins
i've got you beat
says you!
with the tempo that never fails
count on me
to get thmem dancin' down the street
1, 2, 3
'cause when it comes to this
i've got you beat
yeah!
no, no, watch this
no one plays the way that i play
no one plays the way that you play
anytime we two play
when i play when i play, you'll be impressed
when you knew who is clearly the best
i'm the best
nothing wrong with competition
how 'bout girls against the boys
losing every inhibition
as we make a little noise
i'll be faster
i'll be stronger
i'll do that
and i'll do this
we'll see who can hold out longer
and the winner gets a kiss
yuck!
in the sweeping town we come from
there's a melody that plays
and it's anything but humdrum
when you get to know its ways
from the mountains to the ocean
in the east and west
people make their own commotion
with the beat they know the best
i've got you beat
though i must say, although it's true
i've got you beat
in a way, you've got me beat too
look how we, got 'em dancin' down the street
when it comes to that, you've got me beat
when it comes to that, i've got you beat uhna-munha-gunda,uhna-munha-gunda

now you know why the red man's red  j'ai souvent rêvé
d'un lointain pays
où tous les gens m'aimeraient comme
le plus précieux des amis
milles échos de leur joie
montent à l'infini
et leur voix chantent en moi:
tu es né pour cette vie!
je prends le chemin
de mon rêve d'enfance
vers des lendemains
au glorieux destin
parmi les étoiles
je cherche idéal
ce monde auquel j'appartiens
qui est encore, bien loin!
c'est un beau matin
pour saisir cette chance
qui m'emmène au loin
vers d'autres destins
afin qu'en chemin
je découvre enfin
ce que mon coeur cherche en vain:
le monde qui est le mien ! silver and gold
silver and gold
everyone wishes for silver and gold
how do you measure its worth
just by the pleasure it gives here on earth
silver and gold
silver and gold
mean so much more when i see
silver and gold in the sunlight
and the sky that covers me...
silver and gold
silver and gold
lovely to see...and so easily sold
but worth so much more than riches i've found...
are treasures that come from the heart...not the ground
silver and gold
silver and gold
shine with a beautiful light
but silver and gold cannot hold me
or ever shine as bright
as the love i feel tonight...

"he's gonna live and live today."

"i know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death."
he stood prowling when he heard
his fatal sample shred
and then, with glory in his voice
young nathan hale said-

"my only regret is that i have but one life to give for my country."

you possess a gift
but i can speak the jargon that will give your gift the needed lift
you possess the know-how
and i command the show-how
oh how successful you could be
with me
eglantine, eglantine
oh how you shine!
your lot and my lot
have got to combine!
eglantine, eglantine
hark to the stars
destiny calls us
the future is ours
as the shine sells the boot
and the blossoms the fruit
all you need to succeed in your plan
is the proper ally
upon whom to rely
and i'm your man
for i have an acumen
that's nigh superhuman
i sell things that nobody can!
so i humbly suggest
you accept my behest
i'm your man
eglantine, eglantine
oh how you shine!
your lot and my lot
have got to combine!
eglantine, eglantine
hark to the stars
destiny calls us
the future is ours
with my expert pantomiming
the proper taste in timing
i'll introduce you in the manner grand
i'll whet their appetite for you
i'll set the scene so right for you
we'll have the beggars eating out of your hand
as the words sell the tune
and the moonbeams the moon
all you need to succeed in your plan
is a champion rare
with a flourish and a flair
and i'm your man!
i have always had a bit of a knack for witchcraft
common spells and simple charms came naturally
so when the war began
i conjured up a plan
to do my bit in the national emergency
i enrolled in your correspondence college of witchcraft
and i slaved at every lesson as it came
but the spell i counted on
is the lesson that is gone
it's disappeared and you're the one to blame!
your suggestions are rash
and your manner is brash
and i no time to waste mr. brown
if i am to proceed its that book that i need
don't let me down!
but if you'll see my through
i'll discuss it with you
thought i have no taste for playing a clown
if i meet with success then i might acquiesce
i won't let you down!
eglantine, eglantine!
oh, how you’ll shine!
your lot and my lot have got to combine
eglantine, eglantine!

yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared
be prepared!
yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared
be prepared!
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! there was a lover and his lass
sat 'neath a spreading oak
and lest his heart should break apart
the doting lover spoke
"come sing low, come sing high
come change thy name to mine
and you shall eat my capon pie
and drink my malmsey wine."
the maiden turned her head away
and answered, ill at ease
"is it in sport you pay me court
with such low words as these?"
so, come sing low, come sing high
come change thy name to mine
and you shall eat my capon pie
and drink my malmsey wine." i'll show you wealth
you've never seen
the sun and moon and shadows
the rainbow's arch, the mountain stream
the sunless clouds
and the winter's dream
i'll play you sounds
you've never heard
the waterfall, the river
the thunder of the hummingbird
the whisper of the snow
what if you never know
how much you cared
till you are parted
by a stormy sea
how could i let you go?
how could i bear
my life without you
here with me!
the world's a door
that's open wide
because you're here beside me
and with the moon and sun
to guide me
now my heart
can fly
now our hearts
can be freeeeeeee! land of promise, bounteous
this is beautiful, this is beautiful beulah
in the rocky state of maine
land of plenty, meant for us
this is beautiful, this is beautiful beulah
within our reaches there
grapes big as peaches there
the cows and bees are busy
who needs any money in the land of milk and honey?
sweet apple trees abound
wild cherries all around
berries on the vine, rambler roses twine
there so nice. it's a paradise
beulah, land so beautiful
let's set forth on it, let's go north on that train
chug-a-choo, chug-a-choo, chug-a-choo
to beautiful beulah land, beautiful beulah, maine
to beautiful beulah land, beautiful beulah, maine i'm giving love for christmas
to everyone i know
it doesn't need a bow
it only needs to come from your heart
i'm giving love for christmas
so everyone can see
what christmas means to me
it's more than presents under the tree
christmas is all about caring
and as every princess knows
nothing is quiet as warming
when it's storming or it snows
so, i'm giving love for christmas
the best gift that i can give
and in these times we live
it seems more and more, what we're looking for
christmas is being with family
seeing all the friends you've missed
making new christmas memories
that's the first thing on my christmas list
i'd give you everything
if i had everything, it's true
but all that i have is my heart to give
so that's what i'm giving you
i'm giving love for christmas
and hoping that you will too
i will, i will
and hoping that if you do
it just might be me, you give your love to
and that would be
