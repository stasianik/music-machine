broken in all its beauty
processed by pallid eyes
bound together intribulation
beg to see beyond the sky
broken vessel shorn of beauty
purity in pallid eyes
lost inside its tribulation
nothing lives beyond our sky
hold on to hope forever
devote it all with sobbing eyes
love despite our wrathful nations
and never shake the urge to die
imploding in all directions
as my name is forgotten
this broken worldly implication
we will never be forgiven
living as the selves
we can not forgive
leaving for the selves
we can not forgive
imploding in all directions
as my name is forgotten
this broken worldly implication
we will never be forgiven
imploding in all directions
as my name is forgotten
this broken worldly implication
doubles back and scours me i, the burning arrow for the other shore
and seething with a callous rage
a sacred object with a hollow core
and actor on an empty stage
we from the shadow will extend our hands
and turn our gaze towards the flame
the pathways darken as the poison spreads
we languish in this land of waste
i wish for a great mistake
to carry us away
and for an old beginning
where everything's the same
may this strip our minds away
and lead us to our early graves;
contorted and exhausted faces
soiled and ashamed
writhe
your brittle sanctum where your madness grows
a crumbling heart cursed by faith
within, our visions are like fractured glass
we lick the venom from the blade
the red moon rises as the black rain falls
revealing the blood upon our hands
the past we harken as the gateways close
release the plague upon the lands
we saw the signs
and we towed the line
we're lost reflections of forgotten time
realizing, despising
i wish for a great mistake
to carry us away
and for an old beginning
where everything's the same
may this strip our minds away
and lead us to our early graves;
contorted and exhausted faces
soiled and ashamed the place where i have always been free has begun to consume me
i stand along this windswept shore and feel it more and more
you've made your promises, that i have drowned inside
the windswept shore is silent in absence of the tide
the place where i have always been free has begun to consume me
i stand along this windswept shore and feel it more and more
a spirit frayed, a bond was broken; a sudden switch, words were spoken
below the waves there is proof that we have never known the way
you've made your promises, that i have drowned inside
the windswept shore is silent in absence of the tide
...and we stand still, nothing worth changing
no cause to seek within our minds
there will never be another dawn here
a time where i'd feel, a time for taking; and the path to freedom passed us by
watch the waves and wither away here
in sleep, the sea
in peace, in ruin
you've made your promises, that i have drowned inside
the windswept shore is silent in absence of the tide a species was chosen to lie for
a species was chosen to tame
a brain stem, emotion, and devastation
logic suppressed, spirit stripped away
a human was told what to stand for
a human was told who to blame
no questions for answers that retch for freedom
consumed in fire, mortar, and scorched clay
feign grace, save face at all cost
now take our place with all that we’ve lost
belie the machine that hurts you
and you are ashamed
belie the machine that breaks you
and you are to blame
here lie all the lives deserted
kept from the light
a human was told what to stand for
a human was told who to blame
no questions for answers that retch for freedom
consumed in fire, mortar
and scorched clay
a reason was chosen to die for
a reason that no one could name
a grave for its creatures with no distinction
logic suppressed, spiritstripped away
feign grace, save face at all cost
now take our place with all that we’ve lost
belie the machine that hurts you
and you are ashamed
belie the machine that breaks you
and you are to blame
here lie all the lives deserted
kept from the light of day
we will be shaken by the earth
and forsaken by the sun
as cursed rite of birth
is frantically undone
backwards and downwards
through right and left nerves
stripped of all garments
while gasping for words
black sky above and infinite below
manifestations we no longer know
this is not a dream
this indignity.2x

ebb, flow, return again. flower of disease blossoms again
speak; do not tremble. gasp contently and disappear
oh! this dance of distraction; we ponder the pities of plastic and passion
we learn, in cold precise fashion, as we merge with this cancer we've made
behold! eternal returning; arise the black sun, this scorched earth has stopped turning
deceit, our modern condition. we stare at the face of this grand contradiction
speak; do not tremble. gasp contently and disappear
you will hide in the caverns of mountains. vomit, the stench of this iron age
nameless creatures, speaking in tongues forgotten. of fear, born fire and rage
fear, born fire and rage.
only traces are left behind. sorry, silent stares breathing poisoned air
children shrieking towards the sky. hatred they declare, and they care not where

litanies of guilt and shame
walk the line of his creation
carry on his ghastly name
mother asks her child why
the child did not let her die
on bed of tears the tired mother lies
her son, a man undone inside
when all is still and silent
this deep wound is exposed
with broken door forced open
all other doors are closed

punished for my peace, so lowly
even vermin will not clean
flesh from broken bone, so lowly

and all the things i can’t control have slowly rotted me

and beg for a change
in our idle domain
while stars dance overhead
the father is dead
though his malady spread i am sick man, old man, i am corpse; and i ask you for nothing
as i force my way to other shores, i'll ask you for nothing
bind my hands, close my eyes;
let go of this
none is chance, all is life;
you know of this
i am sick man, old man, i am corpse; and i ask you for nothing
as i force my way to other shores, i'll ask you for nothing
i'll go under, deep below the earth and purge;
tear out my innards and burn
turn the mind to darkest light and learn
that none are real with human sight;
this human frame, a most pathetic rite
i'll purge...
purge
none are real with human sight gazing at the world from this mountaintop
locked together; held together, mass disaster
circle is closed as our net is dragged in
illusion of freedom dulls your weakened senses
gazing at the world from this mountaintop
locked together; end together, drawing nearer
circle is closed as our net is dragged in
insulate and isolate together
no escape mechanical inter-dependence 2x
there's a place within the mind; colored splendor there, you'll remember where...
a scene where beauty used to shine, never yours or mine, faded, broken lines...

only traces are left behind. sorry, silent stares breathing poisoned air
children shrieking towards the sky. hatred they declare, and they care not where all we own is regret between birth and death
the human lie manifest
there is no balance to upset, and no one to forget;
this human lie manifest
turning and turning
time is arrow
expand and embrace us
time is arrow
contract and erase us
all we own is regret between birth and death
the human lie manifest
there is no balance to upset, and no one to forget;
this human lie manifest
turning and turning
time is arrow
expand and embrace us
time is arrow
contract and erase us
here is something to remember
this will all return forever
you are nothing but a filter;
broken and mislead forever
all we own is regret between birth and death
the human lie manifest
there is no balance to upset, and no one to forget;
this human lie manifest
turning and turning bereft inside;
malignant guards the shell with feeble pride
body lulled to sleep; bound
bury forms to keep...
shrieking crooked words; near
offer all you hold...
in the end an object upon a burning altar...
body lulled to sleep; bound
bury forms to keep...
shrieking crooked words; near
offer all you hold...
worship the malignant, this beacon of worthlessness;
oppose all you love
the glowing one, she moves with fear in her lying eyes;
she holds all you love
in the end an object upon a burning* altar...
body lulled to sleep; bound
bury forms to keep...
shrieking crooked words; near
offer all you hold... here it comes again, the fractured one of hostile beauty
in this life, it takes the light from our eyes
though we try, we are not made to walk away from this
and we gaze inside, realizing all that's died
binding, enwinding, seducing, stolen light from our eyes
who would not hate you for all that you'll never find?
fear all that's near you and bless all you leave behind
fractured
binding, enwinding, seducing, stolen light from our eyes
who would not hate you for all that you'll never find?
fear all that's near you and bless all you leave behind
fractured
forced to defend a broken process, a pitiful friend
let us pretend that this is never needs to end
here it comes again, the fractured one of hostile beauty
in this life, it takes the light from our eyes
though we try, we are not made to walk away from this
and we gaze inside, realizing all that's died
binding, enwinding, seducing, stolen light from our eyes
who would not hate you for all that you'll never find?
fear all that's near you and bless all you leave behind
fractured father's dream, devour the twin
sisters scream "for our sins."
they'll cut their flesh to make amends
and grasp for ghosts that savior sends
ghosts she sends. those she sends 4x
this beginning is where it ends
we regress for our sins 4x
this road is ending. there'll be no warmth or light beyond
the sun is setting 2x
ghosts she sends. ghosts she sends4x
father's dream, devour the twin
sisters scream "for our sins."
they'll cut their flesh to make amends
and grasp for ghosts that savior sends
ghosts she sends. those she sends 4x here’s to us, to the shells we've protected
to our futile hopes, and the selves we've projected
to shed this skin, we’ll drown in the endless waves
of all our sins and forget everything
i’ll pass on, leaving rain and the stars above
for you to hold; for you to love so much
that you’ll destroy all the things that could have surfaced
it fades away, the wreckage and our "purpose" behold the shape's collapse
it's sic sacred time has passed
one last desperate word
and all distinction blurred
at long last...
the scourge of our eyes removed for all time
a box for a shell, a blank slate for the mind
in stripping away our eternal days
no longer a beast. no longer a slave to the body
it lies with the body
force the stone close
tomb of gods close
silence shown close
tomb of gods close
force the stone
silence shown
mind alone
all is known
the scourge of our eyes removed for all time
a box for a shell, a blank slate for the mind
in stripping away our eternal days
no longer a beast. no longer a slave to the body
it lies with the body

all is known to exist is to fear
fear the i; fear the you

there is a consequence
what if all you need here turns and walks away from you?
what if all you love here never thinks a thing of you?
nothing is ever true

repress distress, and take comfort in this malady

what if all you love here never thinks a thing of you? fire, the thunder, a dream?
