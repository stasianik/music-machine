woe to you, o'er earth and sea
for the devil sends the beast with wrath
because he knows the time is short
let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
for it is a human number
its number is six hundred and sixty six
i left alone, my mind was blank
i needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
what did i see? can i believe that what i saw
that night was real and not just fantasy?
just what i saw, in my old dreams, were they
reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
cause in my dreams, it's always there
the evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
yeah!
the night was black, was no use holding back
cause i just had to see, was someone watching me?
in the mist, dark figures move and twist
was all this for real or just some kind of hell?
666 the number of the beast
hell and fire was spawned to be released
torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
as they start to cry, hands held to the sky
in the night, the fires are burning bright
the ritual has begun, satan's work is done
666 the number of the beast
sacrifice is going on tonight

this can't go on, i must inform the law
can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
but i feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
they seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes
666 the number of the beast
666 the one for you and me
i'm coming back, i will return
and i'll possess your body and i'll make you burn
i have the fire, i have the force
i have the power to make my evil take its course i am a man who walks alone
and when i'm walking a dark road
at night or strolling through the park
when the light begins to change
i sometimes feel a little strange
a little anxious when it's dark
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a constant fear that something's always near
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there

have you run your fingers down the wall
and have you felt your neck skin crawl
when you're searching for the light?
sometimes when you're scared to take a look
at the corner of the room
you've sensed that something's watching you
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have constant fear that something's always near
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there
have you ever been alone at night
thought you heard footsteps behind
and turned around and no-one's there?
and as you quicken up your pace
you find it hard to look again
because you're sure there's someone there
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have constant fear that something's always near
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there

fear of the dark
fear of the dark
fear of the dark
fear of the dark
fear of the dark
fear of the dark
fear of the dark
fear of the dark
watching horror films the night before
debating witches and folklore
the unknown troubles on your mind
maybe your mind is playing tricks
you sense, and suddenly eyes fix
on dancing shadows from behind
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have constant fear that something's always near
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have constant fear that something's always near
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there

when i'm walking a dark road
i am a man who walks alone you'll take my life but i'll take yours too
you'll fire your musket but i'll run you through
so when you're waiting for the next attack
you'd better stand there's no turning back
the bugle sounds, the charge begins
but on this battlefield no one wins
the smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
as i plunge on into certain death
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
the horse he sweats with fear we break to run
the mighty roar of the russian guns
and as we race towards the human wall
the screams of pain as my comrades fall
we hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
and the russians fire another round
we get so near yet so far away
we won't live to fight another day
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

we get so close, near enough to fight
when a russian gets me in his sights
he pulls the trigger and i feel the blow
a burst of rounds takes my horse below
and as i lay there gazing at the sky
my body's numb and my throat is dry
and as i lay forgotten and alone
without a tear i draw my parting groan
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh i'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime
reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the gallows pole
the sands of time for me are running low
running low, yeah
when the priest comes to read me the last rites
i take a look through the bars at the last sights
of a world that has gone very wrong for me
can it be that there's some sort of error?
hard to stop the surmounting terror
is it really the end, not some crazy dream?
somebody please tell me that i'm dreaming
it's not easy to stop from screaming
but words escape me when i try to speak
tears fall but why am i crying?
after all i'm not afraid of dying
don't i believe that there never is an end?
as the guards march me out to the courtyard
somebody cries from a cell "god be with you"
if there's a god why has he let me go?
as i walk my life drifts before me
and though the end is near i'm not sorry
catch my soul, it's willing to fly away
mark my words believe my soul lives on
don't worry now that i have gone
i've gone beyond to seek the truth
when you know that your time is close at hand
maybe then you'll begin to understand
life down here is just a strange illusion

yeah, yeah, yeah... hallowed be thy name
yeah, yeah, yeah... hallowed be thy name
yeah white man came across the sea
he brought us pain and misery
he killed our tribes, he killed our creed
he took our game for his own need
we fought him hard, we fought him well
out on the plains we gave him hell
but many came too much for cree
oh will we ever be set free?
riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
galloping hard on the plains
chasing the redskins back to their holes
fighting them at their own game
murder for freedom the stab in the back
women and children are cowards attack
run to the hills, run for your lives
run to the hills, run for your lives
soldier blue in the barren wastes
hunting and killing their game
raping the women and wasting the men
the only good injuns are tame
selling them whiskey and taking their gold
enslaving the young and destroying the old
run to the hills, run for your lives
run to the hills, run for your lives

run to the hills, run for your lives
run to the hills, run for your lives
run to the hills, run for your lives
run to the hills, run for your lives kill for gain, or shoot to maim
but we don't need a reason
the golden goose is on the loose
and never out of season
blackened pride still burns inside
this shell of bloody treason
here's my gun for a barrel of fun
for the love of living death
the killer's breed or the demon's seed
the glamour, the fortune, the pain
go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
don't you pray for my soul anymore?
2 minutes to midnight
the hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
to kill the unborn in the womb
the blind men shout "let the creatures out
we'll show the unbelievers"
the napalm screams of human flames
of a prime time belsen feast ... yeah!
as the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
we oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies
the killer's breed or the demon's seed
the glamour, the fortune, the pain
go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
don't you pray for my soul anymore?
2 minutes to midnight
the hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
to kill the unborn in the womb

the body bags and little rags of children torn in two
and the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
as the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
to the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun
the killer's breed or the demon's seed
the glamour, the fortune, the pain
go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
don't you pray for my soul anymore?
2 minutes to midnight
the hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
to kill the unborn in the womb
midnight
midnight
midnight
it's all night
midnight
midnight
midnight
it's all night there goes the siren that warns of the air raid
there comes the sound of the guns sending flak
out for the scramble, we've got to get airborne
got to get up for the coming attack
jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
remove all the wheel blocks
there's no time to waste
gathering speed as we head down the runway
got to get airborne before it's too late
running, scrambling, flying
rolling, turning, diving, going in again
running, scrambling, flying
rolling, turning, diving
run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high

move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
let off a sharp burst and then turn away
roll over, spin round to come in behind them
move to their blindsides and firing again
bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
ten me-109s out of the sun
ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
heading straight for them i press down my guns
rolling, turning, diving
rolling, turning, diving, doing it again
rolling, turning, diving
rolling, turning, diving
run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high hear the rime of the ancient mariner
see his eye as he stops one of three
mesmerises one of the wedding guests
stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea
and the music plays on, as the bride passes by
caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale
driven south to the land of the snow and ice
to a place where nobody's been
through the snow fog flies on the albatross
hailed in god's name, hoping good luck it brings
and the ship sails on, back to the north
through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on
the mariner kills the bird of good omen
his shipmates cry against what he's done
but when the fog clears, they justify him
and make themselves a part of the crime
sailing on and on and north across the sea
sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm
the albatross begins with its vengeance
a terrible curse, a thirst has begun
his shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
about his neck, the dead bird is hung
and the curse goes on and on and on and on and on at sea
and the thirst goes on and on for them and me
"day after day, day after day
we stuck nor breath nor motion
as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
water, water everywhere and all the boards did shrink
water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink"
"there," calls the mariner, "there comes a ship o’er the line
but how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?"
see... onward she comes
onward she nears, out of the sun
see, she has no crew
she has no life, wait but there's two
death and she life in death
they throw their dice for the crew
she wins the mariner and he belongs to her now
then... crew one by one
they drop down dead, two hundred men
she... she, life in death
she lets him live, her chosen one
"one after one by the star dogged moon
too quick for groan or sigh
each turned his face with a ghastly pang
and cursed me with his eye
four times fifty living men
and i heard nor sigh nor groan
with heavy thump, a lifeless lump
they dropped down one by one."
the curse it lives on in their eyes
the mariner he wished he'd die
along with the sea creatures
but they lived on, so did he
and by the light of the moon
he prays for their beauty not doom
with heart he blesses them
god's creatures all of them too
then the spell starts to break
the albatross falls from his neck
sinks down like lead into the sea
then down in falls comes the rain
hear the groans of the long dead seamen
see them stir and they start to rise
bodies lifted by good spirits
none of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes
and revenge still is sought, penance starts again
cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on
now the curse is finally lifted
and the mariner sights his home
spirits go from the long dead bodies
form their own light and the mariner's left alone
and then a boat came sailing towards him
it was a joy he could not believe
the pilot's boat, his son and the hermit
penance of life will fall onto him
and the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
and the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins
the mariner's bound to tell of his story
to tell this tale wherever he goes
to teach god's word by his own example
that we must love all things that god made
and the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
and the tale goes on and on and on and on and on from the coast of gold
across the seven seas
i'm travellin' on
far and wide
but now it seems
i'm just a stranger to myself
and all the things i sometimes do
it isn't me but someone else
i close my eyes, and think of home
another city goes by in the night
ain't it funny how it is
you never miss it 'til it's gone away
and my heart is lying there
and will be 'til my dying day
so understand
don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
face up... make your stand
and realize you're living in the golden years
too much time on my hands
i got you on my mind
can't ease this pain, so easily
when you can't find the words to say
it's hard to make it through another day
and it makes me wanna cry
and throw my hands up to the sky
so understand
don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
face up... make your stand
and realize you're living in the golden years

so understand
don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
face up... make your stand
and realize you're living in the golden years
so understand
don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
face up... make your stand
and realize you're living in the golden years to ride the storm to an empire of the clouds
to ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost
to ride the storm to a kingdom that will come
to ride the storm and damn the rest oblivion
royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars
grey lady giant of the skies
you hold them in your arms
the millionth chance they laughed
to take down his majesty’s craft
to india they say magic carpet float away
an october fateful day

mist is in the trees
stone sweats with the dew
the morning sunrise, red before the blue
hanging at the mast, waiting for command
his majesty’s airship, the r101
she’s the biggest vessel built by man
a giant of the skies
for all you unbelievers, the titanic fits inside
drum roll tight her canvas skin, silvered in the sun
never tested with the fury, with the beating yet to come
the fury yet to come
in the gathering gloom
the storm rising in the west
the coxswain stared
into the plunging weather glass
we must go now
we must take our chance with fate
we must go now
for a politician, he can’t be late
the airship crew awake for thirty hours at full stretch
but the ship is in their backbone
every sinew, every inch
she never flew at full speed, a trial never done
her fragile outer cover her achilles would become
an achilles yet to come
sailors of the sky, a hardened breed
loyal to the king and an airship creed
the engines drum, the telegraph sounds
release the cords that bind us to the ground
said the coxswain
“sir, she’s heavy, she’ll never make this flight“
said the captain
“damn the cargo, we’ll be on our way tonight“
groundlings cheered in wonder
as she backed off from the mast
baptizing them her water from the ballast fore and aft
now she slips into our past

fighting the wind as it rolls you
feeling the diesels that push you along
watching the channel below you
lower and lower into the night
lights are passing below you
northern france asleep in their beds
storm is raging around you
a million to one, that’s what he said

reaper standing beside her
with his scythe cuts to the bone
panic to make a decision
experienced men asleep in their graves
her cover is ripped and she’s drowning
rain is flooding into the hull
bleeding to death and she’s falling
lifting gas is draining away

“we’re down lads“ came the cry
bow plunging from the sky
three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die
the flares to guide her path, ignited at the last
the empire of the clouds
just ashes in our past, just ashes at the last
here lie their dreams as i stand in the sun
on the ground where they built and the engines did run
to the moon and the stars
now what have we done?
oh, the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on
dreams live on, dreams live on

now a shadow on a hill, the angel of the east
the empire of the clouds may rest in peace
and in a country churchyard laid head to the mast
eight and forty souls who came to die in france let me tell you a story to chill the bones
about a thing that i saw
one night wandering in the everglades
i'd one drink but no more
i was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
gazing up at the stars
not aware of a presence so near to me
watching my every move
feeling scared and i fell to my knees
as something rushed me from the trees
took me to an unholy place
and that is where i fell from grace
then they summoned me over to join in with them
to the dance of the dead
into the circle of fire i followed them
into the middle i was led
as if time had stopped still i was numb with fear
but still i wanted to go
and the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
as i walked onto the coals
and i felt i was in a trance
and my spirit was lifted from me
and if only someone had the chance
to witness what happened to me
and i danced, and i pranced, and i sang with them
all had death in their eyes
lifeless figures - they were undead - all of them
they had ascended from hell
as i danced with the dead
my free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
below my undead body
just danced the circle of dead
until the time came to reunite us both
my spirit came back down to me
i didn't know if i was alive or dead
as the others all joined in with me
by luck then a skirmish started
and took the attention away from me
when they took their gaze from me
was the moment that i fled
i ran like hell, faster than the wind
but behind i did not glance
one thing that i did not dare
was to look just straight ahead

when you know that your time has come around
you know you'll be prepared for it
say your last goodbyes to everyone
have a drink and say a prayer for it
when you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
and you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
when you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
and you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
to this day i guess i'll never know
just why they let me go
but i'll never go dancing no more
'til i dance with the dead o, god of earth and altar
bow down and hear our cry
our earthly rulers falter
our people drift and die
the walls of gold entomb us
the swords of scorn divide
take not thy thunder from us
take away our pride
just a babe in a black abyss
no reason for a place like this
the walls are cold and souls cry out in pain
an easy way for the blind to go
a clever path for the fools who know
the secret of the hanged man, the smile on his lips
the light of the blind, you'll see
the venom tears my spine
the eyes of the nile are opening, you'll see
she came to me with a serpent's kiss
as the eye of the sun rose on her lips
moonlight catches silver tears that i cry
so we lay in a black embrace
and the seed is sown in a holy place
and i watched and i waited for the dawn, oh
the light of the blind, you'll see
the venom tears my spine
the eyes of the nile are opening, you'll see
go

bind all of us together
ablaze with hope and free
no storm or heavy weather
will rock the boat you'll see
the time has come to close your eyes
still the wind and rain
for the one who will be king
the watcher in the ring
it is you, oh
it is you
it is you into the abyss i'll fall, the eye of horus
into the eyes of the night, watching me go
green is the cat's eye that glows
in this temple
enter the risen osiris, risen again
tell me why i had to be a powerslave
i don't wanna die, i'm a god
why can't i live on?
when the life giver dies
all around is laid waste
and in my last hour
i'm a slave to the power of death
when i was living this lie, fear was my game
people would worship and fall
drop to their knees
so bring me the blood and
red wine for the one to succeed me
for he is a man and a god
and he will die too
tell me why i had to be a powerslave
i don't wanna die, i'm a god
why can't i live on?
when the life giver dies
all around is laid waste
and in my last hour
i'm a slave to the power of death

now i am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
silent the terror that reigned
marbled in stone
a shell of a man, god preserved -
for a thousand ages
but open the gates of my hell
i'll strike from the grave
tell me why i had to be a powerslave
i don't wanna die, i'm a god
why can't i live on?
when the life giver dies
all around is laid waste
and in my last hour
i'm a slave to the power of death
slave to the power of death...
slave to the power of death... i've been looking so long for you now
you won't get away from my grasp
you've been living so long in hiding
and hiding behind that false mask
you know, and i know that you ain't got long now to last
your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past
you're standing in the wings
there you wait for the curtain to fall
and knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
now, i know that you're gonna scratch me and maim me and maul
and you know i'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call
keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait
don't you stray, don't fade away, yeah
watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may
don't you stray from the narrow way, yeah

i'm running and hiding in my dreams, you're always there
you're the phantom of the opera
you're the devil, you're just out to scare
you damaged my mind and my soul, it just floats through the air
you haunt me, you taunt me
you torture me back at your lair
torture me back at your lair here is the soul of a man
here in this place for the taking
clothed in white, stand in the light
here is the soul of a man
time to speak with the shaman again
conjure the jester again
black dog in the ruins is howling my name
so here is the soul of a man
when the world was virgin before the coming of men
just a solar witness, the beginning of the end
from a world of magma to a cold rock face
the ascent of madness and a human race
we are strange believers all of us
there are stranger truths immortal lust
we rise from slumber he calls our name
recalls our number abide with pain
reef in a sail at the edge of the world
if eternity should fail
waiting in line for the ending of time
if eternity should fail
reef in a sail at the edge of the world
if eternity should fail
waiting in line for the ending of time
if eternity should fail
to god’s illusion which i recall
was our delusion before the fall
the angels come and the angels go
but the lord of light shining below
eternal blackness beyond the stars
we think our wisdom will get that far
at the master’s table, the table’s bare
no land of plenty, devastation, despair
reef in a sail at the edge of the world

good day, my name is necropolis

slept in the dust with his daughter
her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
and i will pray for her, i will call her name out loud
i would bleed for her, if i could only see her now
living on a razor's edge
balancing on a ledge
living on a razor's edge, oh
balancing on a ledge, oh
balancing on a ledge, oh
living on a razor's edge
balancing on a ledge, you know, you know
the evil that men do lives on and on
the evil that men do lives on and on
the evil that men do lives on and on
the evil that men do lives on and on
circle of fire, my baptism of joy at an end it seems
the seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
and i will pray for you, some day i may return
don't you cry for me, beyond is where i learn
living on a razor's edge

the evil that men do the morals of life and the perils of death
take the wrong way out running out of breath
meet my match in the afterlife
suppress the demons that plague the night
a tortured mind is a safe place to go
but the truth lurks down in the dark below
step inside my inquisitive mind
are you scared at what you just might find
see myself in the hall of mirrors
a different shape every step i take
a different mind every step of the line
but in the end they are all mine
laughing sorrow inside your head
can’t get out just a feeling of dread
i know this burden's a heavy load
a dark mistake never ending road
the black jack king and the red queen clash
the artful dodger he counts his stash
the joker’s wild like an impish child
while madame fortune she waits inside
the good luck charm is overkill
the tired old soldier says fire at will
planes overhead go search destroy
the ones below human decoy
i need somebody to save me
meanwhile we play the waiting game
the clock is struck the horse is lame
and when we think that this is done

long roads, long days of sunrise to sunset
sunrise to sunset
dream on brothers, while you can
dream on sister, i hope you find the one
all of our lives, covered up quickly
by the tides of time
spend your days full of emptiness
spend your years full of loneliness
wasting love in a desperate caress
rolling shadows of night
dream on brothers, while you can
dream on sister, i hope you find the one
all of our lives, covered up quickly
by the tides of time
sands are flowing and the lines
are in your hand
in your eyes i see the hunger and the
desperate cry that tears the night
spend your days full of emptiness
spend your years full of loneliness
wasting love in a desperate caress
rolling shadows of night

spend your days full of emptiness
spend your years full of loneliness
wasting love in a desperate caress
rolling shadows of night
spend your days full of emptiness
spend your years full of loneliness
wasting love in a desperate caress
rolling shadows of night as the sun breaks above the ground
an old man stands on the hill
as the ground warms to the first rays of light
a birdsong shatters the still
his eyes are ablaze
see the madman in his gaze
fly on your way, like an eagle
fly as high as the sun
on your way, like an eagle
fly and touch the sun
now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
looks the old man in the eye
as he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
"in the name of god, my father, i fly"
his eyes seem so glazed
as he flies on the wings of a dream
now he knows his father betrayed
now his wings turn to ashes, to ashes his grave
fly on your way, like an eagle
fly as high as the sun
on your way, like an eagle
fly and touch the sun
fly, on your way, like an eagle
fly as high as the sun
on your way, like an eagle
fly as high as the sun
on your way, like an eagle
fly, touch the sun
on your way, like an eagle
fly
fly as high as the sun if you're feeling down depressed and lonely
i know a place where we can go
22 acacia avenue
meet a lady that i know
so if you're looking for a good time
and you're prepared to pay the price
fifteen quid is all she asks for
everybody's got their vice
if you're waiting for a long time
for the rest to do their piece
you can tell her that you know me
and you might even get it free
so any time you're down the east end
don't you hesitate to go
you can take my honest word for it
she'll teach you more than you can know
charlotte can't you get out from all this madness?
can't you see it only brings you sadness?
when you entertain your men don't know the risk of getting disease
some day when you're reach the age of forty
i bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
nobody then will want to know
you won't have any beautiful wares to show, any more
22, the avenue
that's the place where we all go
you will find it's warm inside
the red light's burning bright tonight
charlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life
don't you ever think about the bad times
why do you have to live this way?
do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?
sometimes when your strolling down the avenue
the way you walk it makes men think of having you
when you're walking down the street
everybody stops and turns to stare at you
22, the avenue
that's the place where we all go
you will find it's warm inside
the red light's burning bright tonight
beat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please
bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees
abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got
caress her, molest her, she always does what you want?
you're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
you believe that because what you're earning?
your life's good don't you know that it's hurting?
all the people that love you don't cast them aside
all the men that are constantly drooling
it's no life for you stop all that screwing
you're packing your bags, you're coming with me he's walking like a small child
but watch his eyes burn you away
black holes in his golden stare
god knows he wants to go home
children of the damned
children of the damned
children of the damned
children of the damned
he's walking like a dead man
if he had lived he would've crucified us all
now he's standing on his last step
he thought; "oblivion? well, it beckons us all"
children of the damned
children of the damned
children of the damned
children of the damned
now it's burning his hands, he's turning to laugh
smiles as the flame sears his flesh
melting his face, screaming in pain
peeling the skin from his eyes
watch him die according to plan
he's dust on the ground, what did we learn?
ooooooooo-o-o-o-o-ooh
ooooooooo-o-o-o-o-ooh
you're children of the damned
your back's against the wall
you turn into the light
you're burning in the night
you're children of the damned
like candles watch them burn
burning in the light
you'll burn again tonight
children of the damned it's snowing outside the rumbling sound
of engines roar in the night
the mission is near, the confident men
are waiting to drop from the sky
the blizzard goes on, but still they must fly
no one should go where eagles dare
bavarian alps that lay all around
they seem to stare from below
the enemy lines a long time passed
are lying deep in the snow
into the night they fall through the sky
no one should fly where eagles dare

they're closing in, the fortress is near
it's standing high in the sky
the cable cars the only way in
it's really impossible to climb
they make their way but maybe too late
they've got to try to save the day
the panicking cries, the roaring of guns
are echoing all round the valley
the mission complete, they make to escape
away from the eagles nest
they dared to go, where no one would try
they chose to fly where eagles dare wake alone in the hills
with the wind in your face
it feels good to be proud
and be free and a race
that is part of a clan
and to live on highlands
and the air that you breathe
so pure and so clean
when alone on the hills
with the wind in your hair
with a longing to feel
just to be free
is it right to believe
in the need to be free
it's a time when you die
and without asking why
can't you see what they do
they are grinding us down
they are taking our land
that belongs to the clans
not alone with a dream
just a want to be free
with a need to belong
i am a clansman...
freedom
freedom
freedom
freedom
it's a time wrought with fear
it's a land wrought with change
if our ancestors could hear
what is happening now
they would turn in their graves
they would all be ashamed
that the land of the free
has been written in chains
and i know what i want
when the timing is right
then i'll take what i want
i am the clansman
and i swear to defend
and we'll fight to the end
and i swear that i'll never
be taken alive
and i know that we'll stand
and we'll fight for our land
and i swear that my bairns
will be born free
and i know what i want
when the timing is right
then i'll take what is mine
i am the clansman
freedom

accompany them on a journey with no end
to an afterlife that’s rich with fruit of all the gods
and to face the demons
of their underworld haunts
the sentient is sent to seek out all the truth
a flight to earth that is a given from his birth
to rise from ashes of the dead
out of the fire is sent to fulfill man’s desire
by power day and night and death he ruled them
the sky and earth and the fires too
two headed reptile, symbol of his reign
universes of the underworld
a life that’s full of all the wealth and riches
can never last for an eternity
after living in a golden paradise, the ultimate sacrifice
prophecy of sky gods, the sun and moon
passing of old ways will come true soon
falling of ages, forest of kings
the search for the truth, the book of souls
the rulers of planets and stars
the power of the kings of traders and the wars
planetary cycles and the phases of the moon
is in the document a kingdom they will learn
they were praying to the gods of nature
and were living in the cities of stone
towers reaching upward to the heavens
sacred wonders for the world unknown
make their lives be a mystery no more
records kept and the passing of laws
sacred gods to the book of lies
when a civilization dies
prophecy of sky gods, the sun and moon
passing of old ways will come true soon
falling of ages, forest of kings
the lost book of souls, destruction begins

ascending the throne wearing feathers and shells
he brought back their lives from the void
alien invasion brings nothing but death
mass exodus and plant life destroyed
domain of the earth to the journey of truth
the underworld caves, mayan slaves
defeat of the dark lords, the ultimate proof
in the place where the ancestors rule
the book of souls and if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
what do you think you'd expect you would see?
just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
and in the river reflections of me
just for a second a glimpse of my father i see
and in a movement he beckons to me
and in a moment the memories are all that remain
and all the wounds are reopening again
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
and as you look all around at the world in dismay
what do you see, do you think we have learned?
not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
out in the streets where the babies are burnt
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
there are times when i feel i'm afraid for the world
there are times i'm ashamed of us all
when you're floating on all the emotion you feel
and reflecting the good and the bad
will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
can you really tell me what life is?
maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
could be swept away by fate's own hand
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
when you think that we've used all our chances
and the chance to make everything right
keep on making the same old mistakes
makes untipping the balance so easy
when we're living our lives on the edge
say a prayer on the book of the dead
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
we're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
and if you're taking a walk through the garden of life... hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
he knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do?
your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
the piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way
you watch the world exploding every single night
dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
hello to eternity and live for every breath
your time will come
your time will come
your time will come
your time will come
the ferryman wants his money, you ain't gonna give it back
he can push his own boat as you set off up the track
nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame
you watch the world exploding every single night
dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
brothers and their fathers joining hands to make a chain
the shadow of the wicker man is rising up again
your time will come
your time will come
your time will come
your time will come

your time will come
your time will come
your time will come
your time will come
woo-oohh ohh, woo-oohh ohh

he tries to force a smile
the smile it beamed or so it seemed
but never reached the eyes, disguise
masquerading as the funny man do they despise
the false smile maketh of the man
glass empty or half full
try to make some sense or sorrows drown
all looks well on the outside
underneath the solemn truth
there’s something that inside has died
tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes
but the cloud remains the same
wonder why he’s feeling down
tears of a clown
maybe it’s all just for the best
lay his weary head to rest
was forever feeling drowned
tears of a clown
who motivates the motivator?
facade it has to go
he knows it sooner or later
smile for cameras all okay
but tomorrow is another day he must get through
he had a longer way to run
or so the story goes
life full of fun, where did it go?
we saw the sadness in his eyes
it came as no surprise
and now of course we’ll never know
tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes
but the cloud remains the same
wonder why he’s feeling down
tears of a clown
maybe it’s all just for the best
lay his weary head to rest
was forever feeling drowned
tears of a clown
tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
but the cloud remains the same
wonder why he’s feeling down
tears of a clown
maybe it’s all just for the best
lay his weary head to rest
was forever feeling down
tears of a clown, tears of a clown
tears of a clown, tears of a clown eleven saintly shrouded men
silhouettes stand against the sky
one in front with a cross held high
come to wash my sins away
standing alone in the wind and rain
feeling the fear that is growing
sensing the change in the tide again
brought by the storm that is brewing
feel the anxiety hold off the fear
some of the doubt in the things you believe
now that your faith will be put to the test
nothing to do but await what is coming
why is then god still protecting me
even when i don't deserve it?
though i am blessed with an inner strength
some, they would call it a penance
why am i meant to face this alone?
asking the question time and again
praying to god won't keep me alive
inside my head feel the fear start to rise
they'll be saying their prayers when the moment comes
there'll be penance to pay when it's judgement day
and the guilty'll bleed when that moment comes
they'll be coming to claim, take your soul away
the sign of the cross
the name of the rose
a fire in the sky
the sign of the cross
they'll be coming to bring the eternal flame
they'll be bringing us all immortality
holding comunion so the world be blessed
my creator, my god, lay my soul to rest
the sign of the cross
the name of the rose
a fire in the sky
the sign of the cross
lost the love of heaven above
chose the lust of the earth below
eleven saintly shrouded men
came to wash my sins away seven deadly sins
seven ways to win
seven holy paths to hell
and your trip begins
seven downward slopes
seven bloodied hopes
seven are your burning fires
seven your desires...

i am he, the bornless one
the fallen angel watching you
babylon, the scarlet whore
i'll infiltrate your gratitude
don't you dare to save your son
kill him now and save the young ones
be the mother of a birth strangled babe
be the devil's own, lucifer's my name
moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
moonchild, open the seventh seal
i count the heads of those unborn
the accursed ones, i'll find them all
and if you die by your own hand
as a suicide you shall be damned
and if you try to save your soul
i will torment you, you shall not grow old
with every second and passing breath
you'll be so alone, your soul will bleed to death
moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
moonchild, open the seventh seal
moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
moonchild, take my hand tonight
the twins they are exhausted, seven is this night
gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
seven angels, seven demons battle for his soul
when gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die
one more dies, and one more lives
one baby cries, one mother grieves
for all the sins you will commit
you'll beg forgiveness and none i'll give
a web of fear shall be your coat
to clothe you in the night
a lucky escape for you, young man
but i see you damned in endless night
moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
moonchild, open the seventh seal
moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
moonchild, take my hand tonight are you a man of peace, or a man of holy war?
too many sides to you, don't know which anymore
so many full of life, but also filled with pain
don't know just how many will live to breathe again
a life that's made to breathe destruction or defense
a mind that's vain, corruption, bad or good intent
a wolf in sheep's clothing, or saintly or sinner
or some that would believe a holy war winner
they fire off many shots and many parting blows
their actions beyond the reasoning only god would know
and as he lies in heaven, or it could be in hell
i feel he's somewhere here, or looking from below
but i don't know, i don't know
please tell me now what life is
please tell me now what love is
well, tell me now what war is
again, tell me what life is
more pain and misery in the history of mankind
sometimes it seems more like the blind leading the blind
it brings upon us more of famine, death and war
you know, religion has a lot to answer for
please tell me now what life is
please tell me now what love is
well, tell me now what war is
again, tell me what life is
and as they search to find the bodies in the sand
they find it's ashes that are scattered across the land
and as the spirits seem to whistle on the wind
a shot is fired somewhere, another war begins
and all because of it, you'd think that we would learn
but still the body count, the city fires burn
somewhere, there's someone dying in a foreign land
meanwhile, the world is crying, "stupidity of man"
tell me why, tell me why
please tell me now what life is
please tell me now what love is
well, tell me now what war is
again, tell me what life is
please tell me now what life is
please tell me now what love is
well, tell me now what war is
again, tell me what life is
for the greater good of god
for the greater good of god
for the greater good of god
for the greater good of god
for the greater good of god
for the greater good of god
for the greater good of god
for the greater good of god

please tell me now what life is
please tell me now what love is
well, tell me now what war is
again, tell me what life is
please tell me now what life is
please tell me now what love is
well, tell me now what war is
again, tell me what life is
for the greater good of god
for the greater good of god

he gave his life for us, he fell upon the cross
to die for all of those who never mourn his loss
it wasn't meant for us to feel the pain again
tell me why
tell me why lying awake at night, i wipe the sweat from my brow
but it's not the fear, cause i'd rather go now
trying to visualise the horrors that will lay ahead
the desert sand mound a burial ground
when it comes to the time are we partners in crime?
when it comes to the time, we'll be ready to die
god, let us go now and finish what's to be done
thy kingdom come, thy shall be done on earth
trying to justify to ourselves the reasons to go
should we live and let live? forget or forgive?
but how can we let them go on this way?
the reign of terror corruption must end
and we know deep down there's no other way
no trust, no reasoning, no more to say

afraid to shoot strangers
afraid to shoot strangers

afraid...
afraid to shoot strangers!
afraid to shoot strangers
afraid to shoot strangers
afraid to shoot strangers
afraid to shoot strangers infinite dreams, i can't deny them
infinity is hard to comprehend
i couldn't hear those screams
even in my wildest dreams
suffocation waking in a sweat
scared to fall asleep again
in case the dream begins again
someone chasing, i cannot move
standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
what a dream, when will it end and will i transcend?
restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil
one nightmare ends, another fertile
it's getting to me so scared to sleep
but scared to wake now, in too deep
even though it's reached new heights
i'd rather like the restless nights
it makes me wonder, makes me think
there's more to this, i'm on the brink
it's not the fear of what's beyond
it's just that i might not respond
i have an interest, almost craving
but would i like to get too far in?
can't be all coincidence
too many things are evident
you tell me you're an unbeliever
spiritualist?
well me, i'm neither
wouldn't you like to know the truth
of what's out there to have the proof?
and find out just which side you're on
where would you end?
in heaven or in hell?
help me
help me to find my true self without seeing the future
save me
save me from torturing myself even within my dreams

there's got to be just more to it than this
or tell me why do we exist
i'd like to think that when i die
i'd get a chance, another time
and to return and live again
reincarnate, play the game
again and again and again and again can i play with madness?
give me the sense to wonder
to wonder if i'm free
give me a sense of wonder
to know i can be me
give me the strength to hold my head up
spit back in their face
don't need no key to unlock this door
gonna break down the walls
break out of this bad place
can i play with madness?
the prophet stared at his crystal ball
can i play with madness?
there's no vision there at all
can i play with madness?
the prophet looked at me and laughed at me ha ha he said:
can i play with madness?
he said you're blind, too blind to see
said you're too blind to see
i screamed aloud to the old man
i said "don't lie, don't say you don't know"
i say "you'll pay for this mischief
in this world or the next"
oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
and the hell fires raged in his eyes
he said "you wanna know the truth son?
lord, i'll tell you the truth
your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire"
can i play with madness?
the prophet stared at his crystal ball
can i play with madness?
there's no vision there at all
can i play with madness?
the prophet looked at me and laughed at me ha ha he said:
can i play with madness?
he said you're blind, too blind to see
said you're too blind to see
"listen to me," said the prophet
can i play with madness?
the prophet stared at his crystal ball
can i play with madness?
there's no vision there at all
can i play with madness?
the prophet looked at me and laughed at me ha ha he said:
can i play with madness?
he said you're blind, too blind to see
said you're too blind to see
can i play with madness? oh, yeah! yeah!
ow! yeah!
oh yeah!
ow! yeah!
ooh, look out!
you walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back
a footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs
my innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise
the mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night
i have no one, i'm bound to destroy all this greed
a voice inside me compelling to satisfy me
i can see what a life's meant to be
and you'll never know how i came to forsee, see, see

my faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties
with the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike
the death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night
another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light!
i have found you, and now there is no place to run
excitement shakes me, oh god help me what have i done?!
oh yeah, i've done it again!
yeah!
you walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back
a footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs
oh look out, i'm coming for you!
ahahahaha!
oh! oh! another time, another place
a hollow universe in space
i took a trip to see the sights
i will be blacker than the night
one way ticket, no return
my shootin' star so fast it burns
on the edge that you can't see
let's shoot the moon, you and me
i'm not particular you see
just a lonesome galaxy
shadows in the stars
we will not return
humanity won't save us
at the speed of light
shadows in the stars
we will not return
humanity won't save us
we slip into the night
i'll say a mass for you and wave
shootin' plasma from my grave
event horizon lost in space
runnin' in a human race
i don't know where i don't know when
but somehow back there time again
i'm on the edge that you can't see
i’m not particular at night
a single particle of me
you won’t be tracking me by sight
shadows in the stars
we will not return
humanity won't save us
at the speed of light
shadows in the stars
we will not return
humanity won't save us
we slip into the night
shadows in the stars
we will not return
humanity won't save us
at the speed of light
shadows in the stars
we will not return
humanity won't save us
we slip into the night
shadows in the stars
we will not return
humanity won't save us
at the speed of light
shadows in the stars
we will not return
humanity won't save us
we slip into the night
shadows in the stars
we will not return
humanity won't save us
at the speed of light
shadows in the stars
we will not return
humanity won't save us
we slip into the night here they stand, brothers them all
all the sons, divided they'd fall
here await the birth of the son
the seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one
here the birth from an unbroken line
born the healer, the seventh, his time
unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
slowly unveiling the power he holds
seventh son of a seventh son
seventh son of a seventh son
seventh son of a seventh son
seventh son of a seventh son
seventh son of a seventh son
seventh son of a seventh son
seventh son of a seventh son
seventh son of a seventh son
then they watch the progress he makes
the good and the evil, which path will he take?
both of them trying to manipulate
the use of his powers, before it's too late
seventh son of a seventh son
seventh son of a seventh son
seventh son of a seventh son
seventh son of a seventh son
seventh son of a seventh son
seventh son of a seventh son
seventh son of a seventh son
seventh son of a seventh son
today is born the seventh one
born of woman, the seventh son
and he in turn of a seventh son
he has the power to heal
he has the gift of the second sight
he is the chosen one
so it shall be written
so it shall be done in a foreign field he lay
lonely soldier, unknown grave
on his dying words he prays
tell the world of paschendale
relive all that he's been through
last communion of his soul
rust your bullets with his tears
let me tell you about his years

laying low in a blood filled trench
killing time 'til my very own death
on my face i can feel the falling rain
never see my friends again
in the smoke, in the mud and lead
smell the fear and the feeling of dread
soon be time to go over the wall
rapid fire and the end of us all
whistles, shouts and more gun fire
lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
be reunited with my dead friends soon
many soldiers eighteen years
drown in mud, no more tears
surely a war no-one can win
killing time about to begin
home, far away
from the war, a chance to live again
home, far away
but the war, no chance to live again
the bodies of ours and our foes
the sea of death it overflows
in no man's land, god only knows
into jaws of death we go
crucified as if on a cross
allied troops they mourn their loss
german war propaganda machine
such before has never been seen
swear i heard the angels cry
pray to god no more may die
so that people know the truth
tell the tale of paschendale

cruelty has a human heart
every man does play his part
terror of the men we kill
the human heart is hungry still
i stand my ground for the very last time
gun is ready as i stand in line
nervous wait for the whistle to blow
rush of blood and over we go

blood is falling like the rain
its crimson cloak unveils again
the sound of guns can't hide their shame
and so we die in paschendale

dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
running straight at the cannon fire
running blind as i hold my breath
say a prayer symphony of death
as we charge the enemy lines
a burst of fire and we go down
i choke a cry but no-one hears
feel the blood go down my throat
home, far away
from the war, a chance to live again
home, far away
but the war, no chance to live again
see my spirit on the wind
across the lines, beyond the hill
friend and foe will meet again
those who died at paschendale walking through the city
looking oh-so pretty
i've just got to find my way
see the ladies flashing
all their legs and lashes
i've just got to find my way
well... you see me crawling through the bushes
with it open wide
what you seeing, girl?
can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
can't you believe your eyes?
it's the real thing, girl!
got me feeling myself and reeling around
got me talking but feel like walking around

got me feeling myself and reeling
got me talking but nothing's with me
got me feeling myself and reeling around
walking through the city
looking oh-so pretty
i've just got to find my way
see the ladies flashing
all their legs and lashes
i've just got to find my way
well... you see me crawling through the bushes
with it open wide
what you seeing, girl?
can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
can't you believe your eyes?
it's the real thing, girl!
got me feeling myself and reeling around
got me talking but feel like walking around the demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night
the wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed
time, it waits for no man
my future it is revealed
time, it waits for no man
my fate is sealed
if i cancel tomorrow, the undead will thank me today
fly in the face of your prophets, i mock your morality plays
the moon is red and bleeding
the sun is burned and black
the book of life is silent
no turning back
only the good die young
all the evil seem to live forever
only the good die young
all the evil seem to live forever
only the good die young
only the good die young
mystery madman, a victim of cruel charade
some innocent pawn in an endgame, one more stalemate
is death another birthday?
a way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
do the undead live within us and look through our eyes?
walking on water are miracles all you can trust
measure your coffin, does it measure up to your lust?
so i think i'll leave you
with your bishops and your guilt
so until the next time
have a good sin
only the good die young
all the evil seem to live forever
only the good die young
all the evil seem to live forever
only the good die young
only the good die young
seven deadly sins
seven ways to win
seven holy paths to hell
seven downward slopes
seven bloodied hopes
seven are your burning fires
seven your desires... have you heard what they said on the news today?
have you heard what is coming to us all?
that the world as we know it will be coming to an end
have you heard, have you heard?
he sees them in the distance
where the darkened clouds roll
he can feel tension in the atmosphere
he would look in the mirror
see an old man now
does it matter?
they survive somehow
they said there's nothing can be done about the situation
they said there's nothing we can do at all
to sit and wait around for something to occur
did you know, did you know?
as he stares across the garden
looking at the meadows
and wonders if they'll ever grow again
the desperation of the situation getting graver
getting ready when the wild wind blows
have you seen what they said on the news today?
have you heard what they said about us all?
do you know what is happening to just everyone of us?
have you heard, have you heard?
there will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen
there will be something that will light the sky
that the world as we know it
it will never be the same
did you know, did you know?
he carries everything into the shelter, not a fuss
getting ready when the moment comes
he has enough supplies to last them for a year or two
good to have because you never know
they tell us nothing that we don't already know about
they tell us nothing that is real at all
they only fill us with the stuff that they want
did you know, did you know?
he's nearly finished with the preparations for the day
he's getting tired, that'll do for now
they are preparing for the very worst to come to them
getting ready when the wild wind blows
he sees the picture on the wall
it's falling down upside down
he sees a teardrop from his wife
roll down her face, saying grace
remember times they had
they flash right through his mind, left behind
of a lifetime spent together long ago will be gone
they've been preparing for some weeks now
for when the crucial moment comes
to take their refuge in the shelter
let them prepare for what will come
they make a tea and sit there waiting
they're in the shelter feeling snug
not long to wait for absolution
don't make a fuss just sit and wait
i can't believe all the lying
all the screens are denying
that the moments of truth have begun
can't you see it on the t.v.?
don't believe them in the least bit
now the days of our ending have begun
say a prayer when it's all over
survivors, unite all as one
got to try and help each other
got the will to overcome
when they found them
had their arms wrapped around each other
their tins of poison laying nearby their clothes
the day they both mistook an earthquake for the fallout
just another when the wild wind blows unchain the colours, before my eyes
yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
i shall return, from out of the... oh!
tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
tears for somebody, but this lonely boy
out in the madness, the all seeing eye
flickers above us, to light up the... sky!

unchain the colours, before my eyes
yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
i shall return from out of the... fire! i was born into a scene of angriness and greed
and dominance and persecution
my mother was a queen, my dad i've never seen
i was never meant to be
and now i spend my time looking all around
for a man that's nowhere to be found
until i find him, i'm never gonna stop searching
i'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around
'cos i'm a wrathchild
well, i'm a wrathchild
yeah, i'm a wrathchild
i'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah
oh... yeah!
say it doesn't matter, ain't nothin' gonna alter
the course of my destination
i know i've got to find some serious piece of mind
or i know i'll just go crazy
but now i spend my time looking all around
for a man that's nowhere to be found
until i find him, i'm never gonna stop searching
i'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around
'cos i'm a wrathchild
well, i'm a wrathchild
yeah, i'm a wrathchild
i'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah
yeah! i have sailed to many lands
now i make my final journey
on the bow i stand
west is where i go
through the night i plough
still my heart, calculate and pray
as the compass swings, my will is strong
i will not be led astray
mysteries of time, clouds that hide the sun
but i know, but i know, but i know
i see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
as they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
as their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
the sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
take my heart and set it free
carried forward by the waves
nowhere left to run, navigator's son
chasing rainbows all my days
where i go i do not know, i only know the place i've been
dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
nothing's real until you feel
i steer between the crashing rocks
the sirens call my name
lash my hands onto the helm
blood surging with the strain
i will not fail now
as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
for eternity i follow on there is no other way
mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
but i know, but i know, but i know
i see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
as they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
as their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
the sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
take my heart and set it free
carried forward by the waves
nowhere left to run, navigator's son
chasing rainbows all my days
where i go i do not know, i only know the place i've been
dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
nothing's real until you feel
i see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
as they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
as their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
the sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
take my heart and set it free
carried forward by the waves
nowhere left to run, navigator's son
chasing rainbows all my days
where i go i do not know, i only know the place i've been
dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
nothing's real until you feel the only place where you can dream
living here is not what it seems
ship of white light in the sky
nobody there to reason why
here i am, i'm not really there
smiling faces ever so rare
let's walk in deepest space
living here just isn't the place
oh...

stalks of light come from the ground
when i cry there isn't a sound
all my feelings cannot be held
i'm happy in my new strange world
shades of green grasses twine
girls drinking plasma wine
a look at love, a dream unfolds
living here, you'll never grow old
oh, baby...
don't you hear me call?
ooh... winter softly falling to the ground
calmly waiting don’t you hear a sound
when the world has fallen to the depths below
where the future’s open and the fear has grown
and the path to follow to the great unknown
where the dark has fallen and the seed is sown
in the selfish hearts of some
the nightmare’s coming
with the spilling blood of others
now wringing through
now the cup is spilling over
wake to news of death
and the prophecy of sages
destiny is met
to the depths of human mind
the cry is burning
with the mentor’s anger
of the lesson ringing true
and for those who live by and are dying by the sword
they will take their ideals with them
justify their end
where the fools are lying and the meek are crying
where the wolves are preying
on the weak alone
where the sons are dying
hear their mothers crying
and the distant sound of fire
begins again
never ending the desires of men
it’ll never be the same or calm again
in a time of changing hearts
and great unknown
it’ll be the damnation and end of us all
where the fools are lying and the meek are crying
where the wolves are preying
on the weak alone
where the sons are dying
hear their mothers crying
and the distant sound of fire
begins again
never ending the desires of men
it’ll never be the same or calm again
in a time of changing hearts
and great unknown
it’ll be the damnation and end of us all
when the world has fallen
and we stand alone... take a look in the pool and what do you see?
in the dark depths there, faces beckoning me
can't you see them?
it's plain for all to see
they were there, oh i know you don't believe me
oh, i've never felt so strange
but i'm not going insane
i've no doubt that you think i'm off my head
you don't say but it's in your eyes instead
hours i spend out just gazing into that pool
something draws me there, i don't know what to do
oh, they drain my strength away
oh, they're asking me to stay
nightmares, spirits calling me
nightmares, they won't leave me be
all my life's blood is slowly draining away
and i feel that i'm weaker every day
somehow i know i haven't long to go
joining them at the bottom of the pool
now, i feel they are so near
i begin to see them clear
nightmares coming all the time
nightmares will give me peace of mind
now it's clear and i know what i have to do
i must take you down there to look at them too
hand in hand then we'll jump right into that pool
can't you see?
not just me they want you too
oh, we'll drown together
it will be forever
nightmares, forever calling me
nightmares, now we rest in peace if you had the time to lose
an open mind and time to choose
would you care to take a look
or can you read me like a book?
time is always on my side
time is always on my side
can i tempt you, come with me
be devil may care, fulfill your dream
if i said i'd take you there
would you go, would you be scared?
time is always on my side
time is always on my side
don't be afraid, you're safe with me
safe as any soul can be honestly
just let yourself go
caught somewhere in time
caught somewhere in time
caught somewhere in time, ohh
caught somewhere in time
caught somewhere in time
caught somewhere in time, ohh
like a wolf in sheep's clothing
you try to hide your deepest sins
of all the things that you've done wrong
and i know where you belong
time is always on my side
time is always on my side
make you an offer you can't refuse
you've only got your soul to lose
eternally let yourself go
caught somewhere in time
caught somewhere in time
caught somewhere in time, ohh
caught somewhere in time
caught somewhere in time
caught now in two minds, ohh as a young boy chasing dragons
with your wooden sword so mighty
you're st. george or you're david and you always killed the beast
times change very quickly, and you had to grow up early
a house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet
you die as you lived in a flash of the blade
in a corner forgotten by no one
you lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
one man and his honour
the smell of resined leather, the steely iron mask
as you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call
he taught you all he ever knew to fear no mortal man
and now you'll wreak your vengeance in the screams of evil men
you die as you lived in a flash of the blade
in a corner forgotten by no one
you lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
one man and his honour

you die as you lived in a flash of the blade
in a corner forgotten by no one
you lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
one man and his honour
you die as you lived in a flash of the blade
in a corner forgotten by no one
you lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
one man and his honour like a man without a home
watching people come and go
carry on their daily lives
without a thought for the ones alone
cast the dream aside like throwing
a pebble into the ocean tide
and i’m feeling so alone again
free the angry from their pain
free the captives from the chains
cast aside the doubt that
nothing good can come their way again
living in a world of lies
no matter how or hard we try
living life without a dream today
looking through a mist of truth
that we believe an elusive cloud
the things we find are hard to say now
that we live through day to day
find it hard to force the reasons
why we find it hard to die
now we need to know the truth now
open our eyes that we can see
so we live and breathe again
better days for you and me
can we even hope to deliver this
we are so far away
as one turns against the other
with a brother against brother
situation like no other it’s a picture of despair
as we look to see the man of sorrows
passing knowledge to those who don’t know
as we watch all our friends passing over
as they pass through the edges of time
and we see what’s ahead that awaits us
that no longer do we feel afraid
so we look to see the man of sorrows
and the light is the darkness no more yeah, another prophet of disaster
who says this ship is lost
another prophet of disaster
leaving you to count the cost
taunting us with visions
afflicting us with fear
predicting war for millions
in the hope that one appears

ow, ow! ow, ow! tough of the track with the wind
and the rain that's beating down on your back
your heart's beating loud
and goes on getting louder
and goes on even more till the sound is ringing in your head
with every step you tread and every breath you take
determination makes you run, never stop
gotta win, gotta run till you drop
keep the pace, hold the race
your mind is getting clearer
you're over halfway there
but the miles, they never seem to end
as if you're in a dream, not getting anywhere
it seems so futile
run, on and on
run, on and on
the loneliness of the long distance runner
i've got to keep running the course
i've got to keep running and win at all costs
i've got to keep going, be strong
must be so determined and push myself on
run over stiles, across fields
turn to look at who's on your heels
way ahead of the field
the line is getting nearer
but do you want the glory that goes?
you reach the final stretch, ideals are just a trace
you feel like throwing the race
it's all so futile
run, on and on
run, on and on
the loneliness of the long distance runner
run, on and on
run, on and on
the loneliness of the long distance runner feel the sweat break on my brow
is it me or is it shadows that are dancing on the walls?
is this a dream or is it now?
is this a vision or normality i see before my eyes?
i wonder why, i wonder how
that it seems that the power's getting stronger every day
i feel a strength an inner fire
but i'm scared i won't be able to control it anymore
there's a time to live and a time to die
when it's time to meet the maker
there's a time to live, but isn't it strange
that as soon as you're born you're dying
there's a time to live and a time to die
when it's time to meet the maker
there's a time to live, but isn't it strange
that as soon as you're born you're dying
just by looking through your eyes
he could see the future penetrating right in through your mind
see the truth and see your lies
but for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise
there's a time to live and a time to die
when it's time to meet the maker
there's a time to live, but isn't it strange
that as soon as you're born you're dying
there's a time to live and a time to die
when it's time to meet the maker
there's a time to live, but isn't it strange
that as soon as you're born you're dying...
...and be reborn again? giving a swish with your arse in the air
don't you know what they're saying?
charlotte, you're so refined
when you take all the love that they're giving
sticking with every man that you find
don't you know what they're after?
charlotte, you've got your legs in the air

charlotte the harlot, show me your legs
charlotte the harlot, take me to bed
charlotte the harlot, let me see blood
charlotte the harlot, let me see love
taking so many men to your room
don't you feel no remorse?
you charge them a "fiver", it's only for starters
and ten for the main course
and you've got no feelings, they died long ago
don't you care who you let in?
and don't you know you're breaking the law
with the service you're giving?
charlotte the harlot, show me your legs
charlotte the harlot, take me to bed
charlotte the harlot, let me see blood
charlotte the harlot, let me see love
oh, babe
oh, oh, oh, oh
there was a time when you left me standing there
picking up pieces of love off the floor
well, charlotte, you left me alone in there
to make your ends as a bloody whore
well, charlotte, you told me you'd love me true
picking up pieces of love, yesterday
well, charlotte, your drawers are off-color, too, oh
'cause you're making love all day

don't you hear all the laughter?
charlotte the harlot, show me your legs
charlotte the harlot, take me to bed
charlotte the harlot, let me see blood
charlotte the harlot, let me see love was many years ago that i left home and came this way
i was a young man, full of hopes and dreams
but now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained
sometimes things ain't what they seem
no brave new world, no brave new world
no brave new world, no brave new world
night and day i scan horizon, sea and sky
my spirit wanders endlessly
until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why
hear me calling, rescue me
set me free, set me free
lost in this place, and leave no trace
stranger in a strange land
land of ice and snow
trapped into this prison, yea
lost and far from home
one hundred years have gone and men again
they came that way
to find the answer to the mystery
they found his body lying where it fell on that day
preserved in time for all to see
no brave new world, no brave new world
lost in this place, and leave no trace
what became of the man that started
all are gone and their souls departed
left me here in this place
so all alone
stranger in a strange land
land of ice and snow
trapped inside this prison
lost and far from home
what became of the man that started
all are gone and their souls departed
left me here in this place
so all alone
stranger in a strange land
land of ice and snow
trapped inside this prison
lost and far from home
stranger in a strange land... can't understand what is happening to me
this isn't real, this is only a dream
but i never have felt, no i never have felt this way before
i'm looking down on my body below
i lie asleep in the midst of a dream
is it now could it be that the angel of death has come for me?
i can't believe that really my time has come
i don't feel ready, there's so much left undone
and it's my soul and i'm not gonna let it get away
heaven can wait
heaven can wait
heaven can wait
heaven can wait 'til another day
heaven can wait
heaven can wait
heaven can wait
heaven can wait 'til another day
i have a lust for the earth below
and hell itself is my only foe
cause i've no fear of dying, i'll go when i'm good and ready
i snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays
i see a tunnel, i stand amazed
at all of the people standing there in front of me
into the paths of rightness i'll be led
is this the place where the living join the dead?
i wish i knew this was only just a nightmare
heaven can wait
heaven can wait
heaven can wait
heaven can wait 'til another day
heaven can wait
heaven can wait
heaven can wait
heaven can wait 'til another day

take my hand, i'll lead you to the promised land
take my hand, i'll give you immortality
eternal youth, i'll take you to the other side
to see the truth, the path for you is decided
oh oh

my body tingles, i feel so strange
i feel so tired, i feel so drained
and i'm wondering if i'll ever be the same again
is this in limbo or heaven or hell?
maybe i'm going down there as well
i can't accept my soul will drift forever
i feel myself floating back down to earth
so could this be the hour of my rebirth?
or have i died or will i wake from dreaming?
heaven can wait
heaven can wait
heaven can wait
heaven can wait 'til another day
heaven can wait
heaven can wait
heaven can wait
heaven can wait 'til another day honey, it's getting close to midnight
and all the myths are still in town

if there's some living to be done
before your life becomes your tomb

so unchain your back door

be quick! i see the enemy, i know he can’t see me
combat red in tooth and claw
ready now for one more score
took a bullet in my brain
inside i’m the king of pain
outside you will fear my name
i ride a blood red triplane
turn like the devil, shoot straight from the sun
climb like a monkey out of hell where i belong
death or glory, it’s all the same
death or glory, the price of fame
death or glory, i’m in the game of
death or glory, a one way train
i watch you spiral down
dead before you hit the ground
bullet got you in the back
deflection shooting beam attack
i shoot the gunner first
i kill to quench my thirst
i hunt the weakest prey
live to fly another day
turn like the devil, shoot straight from the sun
climb like a monkey out of hell where i belong
death or glory, it’s all the same
death or glory, the price of fame
death or glory, i’m in the game of
death or glory, a one way train
turn like the devil, shoot straight from the sun
climb like a monkey out of hell where i belong
death or glory, it’s all the same
death or glory, the price of fame
death or glory, i’m in the game of
death or glory, a one way train he is the king of all the land
in the kingdom of the sands
of a time tomorrow
he rules the sandworms and the fremen
in a land amongst the stars
of an age tomorrow
he is destined to be a king
he rules over everything
in the land called planet dune
body water is your life
and without it that you would die
in the desert the planet dune
without a still suit you would fry
on the sands so hot and dry
in a world called arrakis
it is a land that's rich in spice
the sand riders and the mice
that they call the 'muad'dib'
he is the kwizatz haderach
he is born of caladan
and will take the gom jabbar
he has the power to foresee
or to look into the past
he is the ruler of the stars
the time will come for him
to lay claim his crown
and then the foe
yes they'll be cut down
you'll see he'll be
the best that there's been
messiah supreme
true leader of men
and when the time
for judgment's at hand
don't fret, he's strong
he'll make a stand
against evil and fire
that spreads through the land
he has the power
to make it all end it's the same in every country when you say you're leaving
left behind my loved ones waiting silent in the hall
where you're going lies adventure others only dream of
red and green light this is real, and so you go to war
for the passion, for the glory
for the memories, for the money
you're a soldier, for your country
what's the difference? all the same
far away from the land of our birth
we fly a flag in some foreign earth
we sailed away like our fathers before
these colours don't run from cold bloody war
there is no one that will save you, going down in flames
no surrender, certain death, you look it in the eye
on the shores of tyranny, you crashed a human wave
paying for my freedom with your lonely unmarked graves
for the passion, for the glory
for the memories, for the money
you're a soldier, for your country
what's the difference? all the same
far away from the land of our birth
we fly a flag in some foreign earth
we sailed away like our fathers before
these colours don't run from cold bloody war
far away from the land of our birth
we fly a flag in some foreign earth
we sailed away like our fathers before
these colours don't run from cold bloody war
far away from the land of our birth
we fly a flag in some foreign earth
we sailed away like our fathers before
these colours don't run from cold bloody war
these colours don't run from cold bloody war have you ever felt the future is the past
but you don't know how?
a reflected dream of a captured time
is it really now? is it really happening?
don't know why i feel this way
have i dreamt this time, this place?
something vivid comes again into my mind
and i think i've seen your face
seen this room, been in this place
something vivid comes again into my mind
all my hopes and expectation
looking for an explanation
have i found my destination?
i just can't take no more
the dream is true, the dream is true
the dream is true, the dream is true
think i've heard your voice before
think i've said these words before
something makes me feel i just might lose my mind
am i still inside my dream?
is this a new reality?
something makes me feel that i have lost my mind
all my hopes and expectation
looking for an explanation
coming to the realisation
that i can't see for sure
i only dream in black and white
i only dream cause i am alive
i only dream in black and white
to save me from myself
i only dream in black and white
i only dream cause i am alive
i only dream in black and white
to save me from myself
the dream is true, the dream is true
the dream is true, the dream is true
i get up, put on the light
dreading the oncoming night
scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
nothing that i contemplate
nothing that i can compare
to letting loose the demons deep inside my head
dread to think what might be stirring
that my dream is reoccurring
got to keep myself from drifting
saving me from myself
i only dream in black and white
i only dream cause i am alive
i only dream in black and white
to save me from myself
i only dream in black and white
i only dream cause i am alive
i only dream in black and white
to save me from myself
lost in a dream of mirrors
lost in a paradox
lost and time is spinning
lost, a nightmare i retrace
lost, a hell that i revisit
lost, another time and place
lost, a parallel existence
lost, a nightmare i retrace
i only dream in black and white
i only dream cause i am alive
i only dream in black and white
to save me from myself
i only dream in black and white
i only dream cause i am alive
i only dream in black and white
to save me from myself

i only dream in black and white
i only dream cause i am alive
i only dream in black and white
to save me from myself
i only dream in black and white
i only dream cause i am alive
i only dream in black and white
to save me from myself
the dream is true, the dream is true
the dream is true, the dream is true
the dream is true, the dream is true
the dream is true, the dream is true i remember it as plain as day
although it happened in the dark of the night
i was strolling through the streets of paris
and it was cold it was starting to rain
and then i heard a piercing scream
and i rushed to the scene of the crime
but all i found was the butchered remains
of two girls lay side by side
murders in the rue morgue
someone call the gendarmes
murders in the rue morgue
flee before the killers go free
there's some people coming down the street
at last someone heard my call
can't understand why they're pointing at me
i never done nothing at all
but i got some blood on my hands
because everyone's shouting at me
i can't speak french so i couldn't explain
and like a fool i started running away
murder in the rue morgue
someone call the gendarmes
murder in the rue morgue
am i ever gonna be free?
and now i've gotta get away from the arms of the law
all france is looking for me
i've gotta find my way across the border for sure
down the south to italy
murders in the rue morgue
i'm running from the gendarmes
murders in the rue morgue
i'm never coming home
well, i made it to the border at last
but i can't erase the scene from my mind
anytime somebody stares at me, well
i just start running blind
well, i'm moving through the shadows at night
away from the staring eyes
any day they'll be looking for me
'cause i know i show the signs of
murders in the rue morgue
i'm running from the gendarmes
murders in the rue morgue
running from the arms of the law
murders in the rue morgue
running from the gendarmes
murders in the rue morgue
am i ever gonna be free?
it took so long and i'm getting so tired
i'm running out of places to hide
should i return to the scene of the crime
where the two young victims died
if i could go to somebody for help
to get me out of trouble for sure
but i know that inside my mind
well, i've got to say i've done it before
murders in the rue morgue
they're never gonna find me
murders in the rue morgue
i'm never going home  we are not the sons of god
we are not his chosen people now
we have crossed the path he trod
we will feel the pain of his beginning
shadow fingers rise above
iron fingers stab the desert sky
oh, behold the power of man
on its tower, ready for the fall
knocking heads together well
raze a city, build a living hell
join the race to suicide
listen for the tolling of the bell
out of the universe
a strange love is born
unholy union
trinity reformed
yellow sun, its evil twin
in the black, the wings deliver him
we will split our souls within
atom seed to nuclear dust is riven
out of the universe
a strange love is born
unholy union
trinity reformed
out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns

bury your morals and bury your dead
bury your head in the sand
e=mc squared, you can relate
how we made god with our hands
what ever would robert have said to his god
'bout how he made war with the sun?
e=mc squared, you can relate
how we made god with our hands
all nations are rising
through acid veils of love and hate
chain letters of satan
uncertainty lead us all to this
all nations are rising
through acid veils of love and hate
cold fusion of fury

divide and conquer while ye may
others preach and others fall and pray
in the bunkers where we'll die
where the executioners, they lie
bombers launch with no recall
minute warning of the missile fall
take a look at your last sky
guessing you won't have the time to cry
out of the universe
a strange love is born
unholy union
trinity reformed

out of the darkness
out of the darkness
brighter than a thousand suns
out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
holy father, we have sinned there's a darkened sky before me
there's no time to prepare
salvage a last horizon
but no regrets from me
maybe i'll be back some other day
to live again just who can say
in what shape or form that i might be
just another chance for me
a hurried time no disgrace
instead of racing to conclusion
and wishing all my life away
no-one can stop me now
time is up it couldn't last
but there's more things i'd like to do
i'm coming back to try again
someday maybe i'll wait till then

but they just don't know it yet
so just a word of warning
when you're in your deepest dreams
there's nothing you can hide from

no more lies! we shall go on to the end
we shall fight in france
we shall fight over the seas and oceans
we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air
we shall defend our island whatever the cost may be
we shall fight on beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds
we shall fight in the fields and in the streets
we shall fight on the hills
we shall never surrender! longboats have been sighted
and the evidence of war has begun
many nordic fighting men
their swords and shields all gleam in the sun
call to arms defend yourselves
get ready to stand and fight for your lives
judgement day has come around
so be prepared - don't run - stand your ground
they're coming in from the sea
they've come the enemy
beneath the blazing sun
the battle has to be won
invaders... pillaging!
invaders... looting!
set ablaze the campfires and alert the other men from inland
warning must be given and there's not enough men here for a stand
the vikings are too many, much too powerful to take on our own
we must have reinforcements, we cannot fight this battle alone
they're coming over the hill
they've come to attack
they're coming in for the killthere's no turning back
invaders... fighting!
invaders... marauding!

axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground
severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lay all around
the smell of death and burning flesh the battle-weary​ fight to the end
the saxons have been overpowered victims of the mighty norsemen
you'd better scatter and run
the battle's lost and not won
you'd better get away
to fight another day
invaders... raping!
invaders... plundering!  she fell in love with his greasy machine
she leaned over
wiped his kick start clean
she'd never seen the beast before
but she left there wanting more and more
but when she was walking
on down the road
she heard a sound that
made her heart explode
he whispered to her to get on the back:
"i'll take you on a ride
from here to eternity!"
hell ain't a bad place
hell is from here to eternity
hell ain't a bad place
hell is from here to eternity
she must be having one
of her crazy dreams
she'd never sat on a piece so mean
i've made her feel like
she's on cloud nine
she even thought
she heard the engine sigh
but like all dreams that come to an end
they took a tumble at the devil's bend
the beast and charlotte
they were two of a kind
they'd always take the line
from here to eternity
hell ain't a bad place
hell is from here to eternity
hell ain't a bad place
hell is from here to eternity
hell ain't a bad place
hell is from here to eternity
hell ain't a bad place
hell is from here to eternity
yes ah, yeah like ah
gentlemen, start your engines!

ha ha ha ha ha! let me tell you 'bout my life
let me tell you 'bout my dreams
let me tell you 'bout the things that happened
always real to me
let me tell you of my hope
of my need to reach the sky
let me take you on an awkward journey
let me tell you why
let me tell you why
why should these curses be laid upon me?
i won't be forgiven 'till i can break free
what did i do to deserve all this guilt?
paid for my sins, for the sale of my soul
demons are trapped all inside of my head
my hopes are gone, reach for heaven from hell
my sins are many
my guilt is too heavy
the pressure of knowing
of hiding what i know
i'm able to see things
things i don't want to see
the lives of a thousand souls
weigh heavy down on me
i know they're crying for help, reaching out
the burden of them will take me down as well
the sin of a thousand souls not died in vain
reincarnation of me
live again
someone to save me
something to save me from myself
to bring salvation
to exorcise this hell
someone to save me
something to save me from myself

someone to save me
something to save me from my hell
a destination away from this nightmare
someone to save me
something to save me from myself
to bring salvation
to exorcise this hell you lead me on the path, keep showing me the way
i feel a little lost, a little strange today
i think i'll take a hold of whatever comes my way
then we'll see what happens, take it day-by-day
i thought i had it all, i had it all worked out
just what the future held, that there would be no doubt
but then the card came up and i took another turn
but i don't know if it's fulfillment that i yearn
tell me what you can hear
and then tell me what you see
everybody has a different way
to view the world
i would like you to know
when you see the simple things

somewhere i'd rather be
but when i get there
i might find it's not for me

or where i want to be
feeling more confused
the more the days go by there's an evil virus that's threatening mankind
not state of the art, a serious state of the mind
the muggers, the back stabbers, the two faced elite
a menace to society, a social disease
rape of the mind is a social disorder
the cynics, the apathy one upmanship order
watching beginnings of social decay
gloating or sneering at life's disarray
eating away at your own self esteem
pouncing on every word that you might be saying
rape of the mind is a social disorder
the cynics, the apathy oneupmanship order
superficially smiling a shake of the hand
as soon as the back is turned, treachery is planned
rape of the mind is a social disorder
the cynics, the apathy oneupmanship order
watching beginnings of social decay
gloating or sneering at life's disarray
when every good thing's laid to waste
by all the jealousy and hate
by all the acid, wit and rapier lies
and every time you think you're safe
and when you go to turn away
you know they're sharpening all their papers knives
all in your mind, all in your head, try to relate it
all in your mind, all in your head, try to escape it
without a conscience they destroy
and that's a thing that they enjoy
they're a sickness that's in all our minds
they want to sink the ship and leave
the way they laugh at you and me
you know it happens all the time
all in your mind, all in your head, try to relate it
all in your mind, all in your head, try to escape it, yeah
the rats in the cellar, you know who you are
the rats in the cellar, you know who you are
the rats in the cellar, you know who you are
the rats in the cellar, you know who you are
or do you? or do you? or do you? or do you?
watching beginnings of social decay believe in me and send no money
i died on the cross, and that ain't funny
but my so called friends they're making me a joke
they missed out what i said like i never spoke
they choose what they wanna hear - they don't tell a lie
they just leave out the truth as they're watching you die
saving your soul by taking your money
flies around shit, bees around honey
holy smoke, holy smoke
plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
feed 'em in feet first this is no joke
this is thirsty work making holy smoke
making holy smoke
jimmy reptile and all his friends
say they gonna be with you at the end
burning records, burning books
holy soldiers, nazi looks
crocodile smiles, just wait awhile
till the tv queen gets her make up clean
i've lived in filth, i've lived in sin
and i still smell cleaner than the shit you're in
holy smoke, holy smoke
plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
feed 'em in feet first this is no joke
this is thirsty work making holy smoke
holy smoke! smells good!

they ain't religious but they ain't no fools
when noah built his cadillac it was cool
two by two they're still going down
and the satellite circus just left town
i think they're strange and when they're dead
they can have a lincoln for their bed
friend of the president - trick of the tail
now they ain't got a prayer - 100 years in jail
holy smoke, holy smoke
plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
feed 'em in feet first this is no joke
this is thirsty work making holy smoke
holy smoke mother russia
how are you sleeping?
middle winter cold winds blow
from the trees the snowflakes drifting
swirling round like ghosts in the snow
mother russia
poetry majestic
tells the tale of a great empire
turning round the old man's ponders
reminiscing an age gone by
mother russia
dance of the tsars
hold up your heads
be proud of what you are
now it has come
freedom at last
turning the tides of history
and your past
mother russia
dance of the tsars
hold up your heads
remember who you are
can you release the anger, the grief?
can you be happy now your people are free? in the gloom, the gathering storm abates
in the ships, gimlet eyes await
the call to arms to hammer at the gates
to blow them wide, throw evil to its fate
all summers long, the drills to build the machine
to turn men from flesh and blood to steel
from paper soldiers to bodies on the beach
from summer sands to armageddon´s reach
overlord, your master, not your god
the enemy coast dawning grey with scud
these wretched souls, puking, shaking fear
to take a bullet for those who sent them here
the world's alight
the cliffs erupt in flame
no escape, remorseless shrapnel rains
drowning men, no chance for a warrior's fate
a choking death, enter hell's gates
sliding we go
only fear on our side
to the edge of the wire
and we rush with the tide
oh, the water is red
with the blood of the dead
but i'm still alive
pray to god i survive
how long, on this longest day
'till we finally make it through?
how long, on this longest day
'till we finally make it through?
how long, on this longest day
'till we finally make it through?
how long, on this longest day
'till we finally make it through?
the rising dead, faces bloated, torn
they are relieved, the living wait their turn
your number's up, the bullet's got your name
you still go on to hell and back again
valhalla waits
valkyries rise and fall
the warrior tombs lie open for us all
a ghostly hand reaches through the veil
blood and sand, we will prevail
sliding we go
only fear on our side
to the edge of the wire
and we rush with the tide
oh, the water is red
with the blood of the dead
but i'm still alive
pray to god i survive
how long, on this longest day
'till we finally make it through?
how long, on this longest day
'till we finally make it through?
how long, on this longest day
'till we finally make it through?
how long, on this longest day
'till we finally make it through?
how long, on this longest day
'till we finally make it through?
how long, on this longest day
'till we finally make it through?
how long, on this longest day
'till we finally make it through?
how long, on this longest day
'till we finally make it through? wandering aimlessly in a cold dark mist i follow
walking in a dark world that’s been
kissed with sadness
without sunlight things are born
to the dead of nightmares
soulless demons laughing in a sea of madness
listen closely to the raven’s call
praying hard for our world not to end
try as might to make sense of it all
will it be for the penance of men
follow north for the call of the wild
look all out for a small wayward child
lay in fear as the dark raven crows
look for guidance from the one who knows
he lived on this earth for a time and a half
playing a tune to the old man’s laugh
the fear that’s inside the men of the oath
in the script of the book that he wrote
ask them the questions
tell them no lies
a cry for freedom
praying that they wouldn’t die
mind over matter
cry over sins
their lives are over now
ended before they begin
as the raven again passes by
i can hear all the wake fathers cry
that the first born of all men will die
that their lives will be taken from them
face the danger a battle of wills
strength and courage a cure for all ills
we believe in that thou shall not kill
but others are ready to spill
the hearts of all men since beginning of time
living with temptation
wanting and crime
a walk in the shadow of the valley of death
knowing i’ll take my last breath
ask them the questions
tell them no lies
a cry for freedom
praying that they wouldn’t die
mind over matter
cry over sins
their lives are over now
ended before they begin
the hearts of all men since beginning of time
living with temptation
wanting and crime
a walk in the shadow of the valley of death
knowing i’ll take my last breath
ask them the questions
tell them no lies
a cry for freedom
praying that they wouldn’t die
mind over matter
cry over sins
their lives are over now
ended before they begin
into the valley of death fear no evil
we will go forward no matter the cost
into the valley of death follow me now
bring me your souls and i’ll make it our last
ask them the questions
tell them no lies
a cry for freedom
praying that they wouldn’t die
mind over matter
cry over sins
their lives are over now
ended before they begin turn the spotlights on the people
switch the dial and eat the worm
take your chances, kill the engine
drop your bombs and let it burn
white flags shot to ribbons
the truce is black and burned
shellshock in the kitchen
tables overturned
back in the village again
in the village
i'm back in the village again
throwing dice now, rolling loaded
i see sixes all the way
in a black hole, and i'm spinning
as my wings get shot away
questions are a burden
and answers are a prison for oneself
shellshock in the kitchen
tables start to burn
back in the village again
in the village
i'm back in the village again

no breaks on the inside
paper cats and burning barns
there's a fox among the chickens
and a killer in the hounds
questions are a burden
and answers are a prison for oneself
shellshock in the kitchen
tables start to burn
back in the village again
in the village
i'm back in the village again
but still, we walk into the valley
and others try to kill the inner flame
we're burning brighter than before
i don't have a number, i'm a name!
back in the village again
in the village
i'm back in the village again
back in the village again
in the village
i'm back in the village again
back in the village
i'm back in the village
i'm back in the village again look for something that is hard to find
searching somewhere deep inside your mind
hope you find just what you’re looking for
heaven’s waiting with an open door
if you should sell your soul as cheaply as i did then
the road to ruin is a long road to hide in
we signed our lives away to have an escape
it’s something that will be whatever our fate
there’s no use in hiding
got to keep on trying
can’t take no more lying
this is the last
there’s no time for crying
when some of us are dying
none of us decide what is our fate
now with nothing to hide going nowhere
take my chances and stand by their side
when the river runs deep
and the line breaks
and the blood it flows
free from our lives
is this the last together maybe this time now
we stand together and we’re holding the line here
there’s nothing we can do just sit here and wait
the die is cast that is deciding our fate
there’s no use in hiding
got to keep on trying
can’t take no more lying
this is the last
there’s no time for crying
when some of us are dying
none of us decide what is our fate
now with nothing to hide going nowhere
take my chances and stand by their sides
when the river runs deep
and the line breaks
and the blood it flows
free from our lives
now with nothing to hide going nowhere
take my chances and stand by their sides
when the river runs deep
and the line breaks
and the blood it flows
free from our lives
now with nothing to hide going nowhere
take my chances and stand by their sides
when the river runs deep
and the line breaks
and the blood it flows
free from our lives
now with nothing to hide going nowhere
take my chances and stand by their sides
when the river runs deep
and the line breaks
and the blood it flows
free from our lives he threw down a glove, you made the mistake
of picking it up, now you're gone
the choosing of guns or fighting with swords
the choice of weapons is done
he'll tear you apart, as soon as you start
you know you don't have a chance
oh, oh, fight for the honour
fight for the splendour
fight for the pleasure
oh, oh, fight for the honour
fight for the splendour
fight for your life
ready to start, the duel begins
the best man wins in the end
a lunge and a feint, a parry too late
a cut to the chest and you're down
seeing the stain, then feeling the pain
feeling the sweat on your brow
oh, oh, fight for the honour
fight for the splendour
fight for the pleasure
oh, oh, fight for the honour
fight for the splendour
fight for your life

the fighting resumes, a silence looms
the swordsmen move against each other
a cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow
a stab to the heart and you're down
the angel of death hears your last breath
meanwhile, the reaper looks on
oh, oh, fought for the honour
fought for the splendour
fought for the pleasure
oh, oh, fought for the honour
fought for the splendour
fought to the death out of the silent planet
out of the silent planet we are
out of the silent planet
out of the silent planet we are
out of the silent planet
out of the silent planet we are
out of the silent planet
out of the silent planet we are
withered hands, withered bodies
begging for salvation
deserted by the hand of gods of their own creation
nations cry underneath decaying skies above
you are guilty
the punishment is death for all who live
the punishment is death for all who live
out of the silent planet
dreams of desolation
out of the silent planet
come the demons of creation
out of the silent planet
dreams of desolation
out of the silent planet
come the demons of creation
the killing fields, the grinding wheels
crushed by equilibrium
separate lives, no more disguise
no more second chances
haggard wisdom, spitting out the bitter taste of hate
i accuse you
before you know the crime, it's all too late
before you know the crime, it's all too late
out of the silent planet
dreams of desolation
out of the silent planet
come the demons of creation
out of the silent planet
dreams of desolation
out of the silent planet

out of the silent planet
out of the silent planet we are
out of the silent planet
out of the silent planet we are i don't care for this world anymore
i just want to live my own fantasy
fate has brought us to these shores
what was meant to be is now happening
i've found that i like this living in danger
living on edge it feels, it makes us feel as one
who cares now what's right or wrong
it's reality
killing so we survive
wherever we may roam
wherever we may hide
we've got to get away
i don't want existence to end
we must prepare ourselves for the elements
i just want to feel like we're strong
we don't need a code of morality
i like all the mixed emotion and anger
it brings out the animal the power you can feel
and feeling so high with this much adrenalin
excited but scary to believe what we've become
saints and sinners
something within us
we are lord of the flies
saints and sinners
something willing us
to be lord of the flies

saints and sinners
something within us
we are lord of the flies
saints and sinners
something willing us
to be lord of the flies
saints and sinners
something within us
we are lord of the flies
saints and sinners
something willing us
to be lord of the flies when i was wandering in the desert
i was searching for the truth
i heard a choir of angels calling out my name
i had the feeling that my life would never be the same again
i turned my face towards the barren sun
and i know of the pain
that you feel the same as me
and i dream of the rain
as it falls upon the leaves
and the cracks in our lives
like the cracks upon the ground
they are sealed and are now washed away
you tell me we can start the rain
you tell me that we all can change
you tell me we can find something
to wash the tears away
you tell me we can start the rain
you tell me that we all can change
you tell me we can find something
to wash the tears
and i know of the pain
that you feel the same as me
and i dream of the rain
as it falls upon the leaves
and the cracks in the ground
like the cracks are in our lives
they are sealed and are now far away
you tell me we can start the rain
you tell me that we all can change
you tell me we can find something
to wash the tears away
you tell me we can start the rain
you tell me that we all can change
you tell me we can find something
to wash the tears

you tell me we can start the rain
you tell me that we all can change
you tell me we can find something
to wash the tears away
you tell me we can start the rain
you tell me that we all can change
you tell me we can find something
to wash the tears
and i know of the pain
that you feel the same as me
and i dream of the rain
as it falls upon the leaves
and the cracks in the ground
like the cracks are in our lives
they are sealed and are now far away you killed your first man at 13
killer instinct, animal supreme
by 16, you had learned to fight
the way of the warrior you took it as your right
sunlight, falling on your steel
death in life is your ideal
life is like a wheel, rolling on and on
through earth and water, fire and wind
you came at last - nothing was the end
make a cut by fire and stones
take you and your blade and break you both
in two - break you both in two
sunlight, falling on your steel
death in life is your ideal
life is like a wheel, rolling on and on

sunlight, falling on your steel
death in life is your ideal
life is like a wheel, rolling on and on
sunlight, falling on your steel
death in life is your ideal
life is like a wheel, rolling on and on
sunlight, falling on your steel
death in life is your ideal
life is like a wheel - and it's rolling still  thinking of an age old dream
places i have never seen
fantasies lived times before
i split my brain, melt through the floor
over clouds my mind will fly
forever now i can't think why
my body tries to leave my soul
is it me, i just don't know
mem'ries rising from the past
the future's shadow's overcast
something's clutching at my head
through the darkness, i'll be led
oh, another time, another place
oh, another smile on another face
when you see me floating up beside you
you get the feeling that all my love's inside of you
please take me away, take me away, so far away
please take me away, take me away, so far away
please take me away, take me away, so far away, hey!
thinking of an age old dream
places i have never seen
fantasies lived times before
i split my brain, melt through the floor
over clouds my mind will fly
forever now, i can't think why
my body tries to leave my soul
or is it me, i just don't know
mem'ries rising from the past
the future's shadow's overcast
something's clutching at my head
through the darkness, i'll be led
oh, another time, another place
oh, another smile on another face
when you see me walking up beside you
you get the feeling that all my love's inside of you
please take me away, take me away, so far away
please take me away, take me away, so far away
please take me away, take me away, so far away! now that i know that the right time has come
my prediction will surely be true
the impending disaster, it looms
and the whole of the village is doomed
why won't you listen to me?
is it so hard to understand?
that i am the real seventh son
your life or death on me depends
suffering and pain, impending disaster
souls crying, the devil's laughter
i heard the cry of the seven whistlers
lucifer smiles, looks on and awaits
i'll take your life in my hands
your fate, your fortune's in my vision
heed what i say and you'll see what will be
please listen to me
now that they see the disaster is done
now they put all the blame on to me
they feel i brought on a curse
don't they know that the torment it stays with me?
knowing that i walk alone
through the eyes of the future, i see
they don't even know what fear is
don't they know i'm the one who is cursed?
purgatory beckons, souls lost forever
life after death or heaven hereafter
heard the call of the seven whistlers again
now lucifer laughs, hell awaits
i had their lives in my hands
their fate, their fortunes in my vision
no one believed in my true prophecy
and now it's too late when a person turns to wrong
is it a want to be, belong?
part of things at any costs
at what price life is lost
at what point do we begin?
fighter spirit, a will to win
but what makes a man decide
take the wrong or righteous road?
there's a thin line between love and hate
wider divide that you can see between good and bad
there's a grey place between black and white
but everyone does have the right
to choose the path that he takes
we all like to put the blame on society these days
but what kind of good or bad a new generation brings
sometimes takes just more than that
to survive, be good at heart
there is evil in some of us
no matter what will never change
i will hope, my soul will fly
so i will live forever
heart will die, my soul will fly
and i will live forever
just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
just a thin line draw between being a genius or insane
at what age begin to learn of what way out we will turn?
there's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn
there's a thin line between love and hate
wider divide that you can see between good and bad
there's a grey place between black and white
but everyone does have the right
to choose the path that he takes
i will hope, my soul will fly
so i will live forever
heart will die, my soul will fly
and i will live forever
i will hope, my soul will fly
so i will live forever
heart will die, my soul will fly
and i will live forever
the thin line between love and hate
the thin line between love and hate shadows may hide you but also may be your grave
you're running today maybe tomorrow you'll be saved
you pray for the daylight to save you for a while
you wonder if your children will face the killer's smile
dead men, tell no tales
gangland, murder's up for sale
dead men, tell no tales
gangland, where the jail birds die
face at the window leers into your own
but it's only your reflection still you tremble in your bones
how long can you hide? how long till they come?
a rat in a trap but you've got to survive
once you were glad to be free for a while
the air tasted good and the world was your friend
then came the day when the hard times began
now you're alone but alive for how long?
dead men, tell no tales
gangland, murder's up for sale
dead men, tell no tales
gangland, where the jail birds die

a knife at your throat another body on the pile
a contract to keep and it's service with a smile
murder for vengeance or murder for gain
death on the streets or a blackened out jail
dead men, tell no tales
gangland, murder's up for sale
dead men, tell no tales
gangland, where the jail birds die
dead men, gangland
murder, gangland
tell no tales i'd sail across the ocean
i'd walk a hundred miles
if i could make it to the end
oh just to see a smile
you see it in their faces
the sadness in their tears
the desperation and the anger
madness and the fear
no hope, no life, just pain and fear
no food, no love, just greed is here
starvation and the hunger
the suffering and the pain
the agonies of all-out war
when will it come again?
the struggle for the power
a tyrant tries again
just what the hell is going on?
when will it ever end?

you see the full moon float
you watch the red sun rise
we take these things for granted
but somewhere someone's dying
contaminated waters
pollution and decay
just waiting for disease to strike
oh will we learn someday?
no hope, no life, just pain and fear
no food, no love, no seed
childhood's end got to tell you a story
on a cold winter's night
you'll be sailing for glory
before you know what is right
so come over here now
i got a vision for you
it's my personal snake oil
it's just something i do
i'm the jester with no tears
and i'm playing on your fears
i'm a trickster smiling underneath
this mask of love and death
the eternal lie i've told
about the pyramids of gold
i've got you hooked at every turn
your money's left to burn
hahaha
you'll be wanting a contract
you'll be waiting awhile
i'd like to give you my contact
but that isn't my style
well you only get one chance
and it's too good to miss
if i didn't lie to you
then i wouldn't exist
greed, lust and envy pride
it's the same old same old ride
the smoke and mirrors visions
that you see are just like me
i'm a clever banker's face
with just a letter out of place
i know someone just like you
knows someone just like me
el dorado, come and play
el dorado, step this way
take a ticket for the ride
el dorado streets of gold
see my ship is oversold
you got one last chance to try
so gone is the glory
and gone is the gold
well if you knew the story
how come it has to be told
well you can say i'm a devil
and i wouldn't say no
but out here on the dark side
hey! on with the show
so then my tale is told
big and bad and twice as bold
this ship of fools is sinking
as the cracks begin to grow
there is no easy way
for an honest man today
which is something you should think of
as my lifeboat sails away
el dorado, come and play
el dorado, step this way
take a ticket for the ride
el dorado streets of gold
see my ship is oversold
you got one last chance to try trace your way back 50 years
to the glow of dresden - blood and tears
in the black above by the cruel searchlight
men will die and men will fight - yeah
who shot who and who fired first?
dripping death to whet the bloodthirst
no radar lock on - skin and bone
the bomber boys are going home
climb into the sky
never wonder why
tailgunner
you're a tailgunner
climb into the sky
never wonder why
tailgunner
you're a tailgunner
climb into the sky
never wonder why
tailgunner
you're a tailgunner

nail that fokker kill that son

tailgunner
you're a tailgunner
climb into the sky

tailgunner

climb into the sky
never wonder why
tailgunner
you're a tailgunner there are times when i've wondered
and times when i've cried
when my prayers, they were answered
at times when i've lied
but if you asked me a question
would i tell you the truth?
now there's something to bet on
you've got nothing to lose
when i've sat by the window
and gazed at the rain
with an ache in my heart
but never feeling the pain
and if you would tell me
just what my life means
walking a long road
never reaching the end
god, give me the answer to my life
god, give me the answer to my dreams
god, give me the answer to my prayers
god, give me the answer to my being tell you a thing that you ought to know
two minutes of your time, then on you go
tell tale of the men all dressed in black
that most of them, not coming back
sent off to war to play little games
and on their return, can't name no names
some strange yellow gas has played with their minds
has reddened their eyes, removed all the lies
and strange as it sounds, death knows no bounds
how many get well?
only time will tell
only time will tell
you lie in your death bed now
but what did you bring to the table?
brought us only holy sin
utter trust is a deadly thing
to the prayer of holy peace
we didn't know what was lying underneath
so how could we be such fools?
and to think that we thought you the answer
i can't begin to understand in all the lies
but on your death bed, i can see it in your eyes
just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow
it really makes sense, i can really see it clearly now
tangled up in a web of lies
could have been a way to prophesize
unaware of the consequence
not aware of the secrets that you kept
nothing that we could believe
to reveal the facade of faceless men
not a thing that we could foresee
now a sign that would tell us the outcome
you had us all strung out with promises of peace
but all along, your cover plan was to deceive
can it put to rights now?
only time will tell
your prophecies will send us all to hell as well
left to all our golden sons
all to pick up on the peace
you could have given all of them
a little chance, at least
take the world to better place
given them all just a little hope
just think what a legacy you now will leave

we seemed destined to live in fear
and some that would say armageddon is near
but where there's a life, while there's hope
that man won't self-destruct
why can't we treat our fellow men
with more respect and a shake of their hands?
but anger and loathing is rife
the death on all sides is becoming a way of life
we live in an uncertain world
fear, understanding and ignorance is leading to death
only the corpses are left
for vultures that prey on their bones
but some are just not wanting peace
their whole life is death and misery
the only thing that they know;
"fight fire with fire, life is cheap"
but if they do stop to think
that man is teetering right on the brink
but do you think that they care?
they benefit from death and pain and despair out in the street somebody's crying
out in the night the fires burn
maybe tonight somebody's crying
reached the point of no return
oh, my eyes, they see but i can't believe
oh, my heart is heavy as i turn my back and leave
like the eagle and the dove
fly so high on wings above
when all you see can only bring you sadness
like a river we will flow
on towards the sea we go
when all you do can only bring you sadness
out on the sea of madness
somewhere i hear a voice that's calling
out in the dark there burns a dream
you got to hope when you are falling
to find the world that you have seen
oh, my eyes, they see but i can't believe
oh, my heart is heavy as i turn my back and leave
like the eagle and the dove
fly so high on wings above
when all you see can only bring you sadness
like a river we will flow
on towards the sea we go
when all you do can only bring you sadness
out on the sea of madness
it's madness
the sun don't shine on the sea of madness
there ain't no wind to fill your sails
madness
when all you see can only bring you sadness
on towards the sea we go
out in the night somebody's crying
out in the night the fires burn
maybe tonight somebody's crying
reached the point of no return
oh, my eyes, they see but i can't believe
oh, my heart is heavy as i turn my back and leave
like the eagle and the dove
fly so high on wings above
when all you see can only bring you sadness
like a river we will flow
on towards the sea we go
when all you do can only bring you sadness
out on the sea of madness when i stand before you shining in the early morning sun
when i feel the engines roar and i think of what we've done
oh, the bittersweet reflection as we kiss the earth goodbye
as the waves and echoes of the towns become the ghosts of time
over borders that divide the earthbound tribes
no creed and no religion just a hundred winged souls
we will ride this thunderbird, silver shadows on the earth
a thousand leagues away, our land of birth
to albion's land, coming home
when i see the runway lights
in the misty dawn the night is fading fast
coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
where i've been tonight, you know i will not stay
curving on the edge of daylight
til it slips into the void
waited in the long night
dreaming til the sun is born again
stretched the fingers of my hand, covered countries with my span
just a lonely satellite, speck of dust and cosmic sand
over borders that divide the earthbound tribes
flown the dark atlantic over mariners' stormy graves
we will ride this thunderbird, silver shadows on the earth
a thousand leagues away, our land of birth
to albion's land, coming home
when i see the runway lights
in the misty dawn the night is fading fast
coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
where i've been tonight, you know i will not stay
to albion's land, coming home
when i see the runway lights
in the misty dawn the night is fading fast
coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
where i've been tonight, you know i will not stay
coming home, far away when i see the runway lights
in the misty dawn the night is fading fast
coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
where i've been tonight, you know i will not stay the freeway is jammed
and it's backed up for miles
the car is an oven and baking is wild
nothing is ever the way it should be
what we deserve we just don't get you see
a briefcase, a lunch and a man on the edge
each step gets closer to losing his head
is someone in heaven? are they looking down?
cause nothing is fair just you look around
falling down
falling down
falling down
he's sick of waiting of lying like this
there's a hole in the sky for the angels to kiss
branded a leper because you don't fit
in the land of the free
you just live by your wits
once he built missiles a nations defence
now he can't even give birthday presents
across the city he leaves in his wake
a glimpse of the future a cannibal state
falling down
falling down
falling down
the freeway is jammed
and it's backed up for miles
the car is an oven and baking is wild
nothing is ever the way it should be
what we deserve we just don't get you see
a briefcase, a lunch and a man on the edge
each step gets closer to losing his head
is someone in heaven? are they looking down?
cause nothing is fair just you look around
falling down
falling down
falling down lights out, we live in a world of darkness
no doubt, everything's up for sale
we sleep, all of the world is burning
we pray to god for a better deal
nothing is sacred
back then or now
everything's wasted
is that all there is?
can i go now?
judas, my guide
whispers in the night
judas, my guide
fight wars, die in a blaze of glory
come home, meat in a plastic sack
fall down, better pray to your god for mercy
so kneel and help the blade cut clean
nothing is sacred
back then or now
everyone's wasted
is that all there is?
is that it now?
 2x
i live in the black
i have no guiding light
i whisper in your dreams
 2x listen to me, lamia, listen to what i've got to say
i've got these feelings and they won't go away
i've got these fears inside that'll bring me to my knees
oh, help me, lamia, or i'm sure i'll die, oh, please
i feel unsettled, now i know that i've done wrong
i've messed around with mystic things and magic for far too long
i feel i'm being paid with this nightmare inside me
the devil's got a hold on my soul and he just won't let me be
i'm on my knees, oh, help me, please
i'm on my knees, help me please
oh, lamia, please try to help me
the devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be
lamia, i've got this curse, i'm turning to bad
the devil's got a hold of my soul, he's driving me mad
oh...

oh, lamia, please try to help me
the devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be
lamia, i've got this curse, i'm turning to bad
the devil's got a hold of my soul, he's driving me mad
oh... when i stand and look about the port
and contemplate my life
will i ever see my countrymen again?
as the captain calls us on the deck
i take my things and walk
to the harbour side
i glance back one last time
fleeing our nation, our problems we leave behind
ships by the tenfold sail out on the tide
we are pleased to be out and embracing the open sea
free from our troubles and more free from thee
inheritors unfulfilled reason behind us
we flee from what is not, what is will be
we flee the earth and face our harsh reality
will death be low mist that hangs on the sea?
we run from evil tongues
rash judgements, selfish men
never to be seen on these shores again
as we sail into ocean size
and lose sight of land
face of contentment around in the air
we're off now to seek all our fortunes
to the land of our dreams....
riding the waves and the storm is upon us
the winds lash the sails
but the ropes keep them tight
off in the distance a dark cloud approaching
none could imagine what there was to come
no, there's no-one going back
no, there's not a second chance
as we strap onto the side
we pray to god that we won't die
as we ride the rough seas
as we soak from the ocean waves
i just hope for all our lives
and pray that i survive
four ships are lost in the stormy conditions
the spirits of the sunken crews
their phantoms follow us
spirits sails, they drive us on
through the all-consuming waves
cold mortality, no weapon
against these ever raging seas
four leagues and ten and we hit storms again
we just can't get away from the eye of the storm
the birds outsoar the raging storm
but we cannot escape it
abandoned earth, that we now crave
is many leagues from save
holding on for our dear lives
and we're praying once again
rotten luck or just jonahed?
the talisman is in my hand
limbs fatigue, trembling with cold
blinded from the sea spray salt
clasping anything we can hold
heaven's rain upon us falls
twenty days without a meal
and ten without fresh water still
those that didn't die in storms
the scurvy rest did slaughter
westward the tide
westward we sail on
westward the tide
sail by the talisman
we approach the other side
of the ocean with the tide
in our favour just for once
welcome greeting our new land
the elation in our hearts
the excitement in our veins
as we sail towards the coastline
of our golden promised land
weary limbs fatigued away
i have no life left in me
no more strength
no nothing left to give
must find the will to live
never thought that we could make it
truly sight of shores divine
the sickness i am dying from
never wanted it to end this way
x2  i try to call the earth's command
desperation in my voice
i'm drifting way off course now
with very little choice
the loneliness is hard to bear
i try to calm my fear
just hoping any second now
some contact filters through
desperate calls
signal back from satellite
as my life
flashes right in front of me
try again
must get through
hear me now
for i've very little time
not much time
hear my call
please get through
i am here
i'm stranded in space
i'm lost without trace
i haven't a chance of getting away
too close to the sun
i surely will burn
like icarus before me or so legend goes
i think of my life
reliving my past
there's nothing but wait till my time comes
i've had a good life
i'd do it again
maybe i'll come back some time afresh
for i have lived my life to the full
i have no regrets
but i wish i could talk to my family
to tell them one last goodbye
the final frontier
the final frontier
the final frontier
the final frontier
if i could survive
to live one more time
i wouldn't be changing a thing at all
done more in my life
than some do in ten
i'd go back and do it all over again
there isn't much time
must say my last rites
nobody is here to read them to me
must say my goodbyes
if only a line
a message to tell them in case they might find
the final frontier
the final frontier
the final frontier
the final frontier
the final frontier
the final frontier
the final frontier
the final frontier there are secrets that you keep
there are secrets that you keep
there are secrets that you tell to me alone
i can't reach things i can't see
you don't see this strange world quite the same as me
don't deny me what i am
nothing hidden, still you fail to see the truth
these are things you can't reveal
these are things you can't reveal
we are part of some strange plan
why the slaughter of the brotherhood of man?
infernal sacrifice of hell
fire breathing, lead the way
mounds of bodies, as they all burn into one
revenge is living in the past
time to look into a new millennium
spiral path leads through the maze
down into the fiery underworld below
fire breathing, lead the way
lucifer was just an angel led astray
free your soul and let it fly
give your life to the lord of light
keep your secrets and rain on me
all i see are mysteries
free your soul and let it fly
give your life to the lord of light
keep your secrets and rain on me
all i see are mysteries
we are not worthy in your black and blazing eyes
we gather demons in the mirror every day
the bridge of darkness casts a shadow on us all
and all our sins, to you, we give, this day
others wait their turn, their lives were meant to last
use yours wisely, as the light is fading fast
free your soul and let it fly
mine was caught, i couldn't try
time returns again to punish all of us
we are cast out by our bloody father's hand
we are strangers in this lonely promised land
we are the shadows of the one unholy ghost
in our nightmare world, the only one we trust

free your soul and let it fly
give your life to the lord of light
keep your secrets and rain on me
all i see are mysteries
free your soul and let it fly
give your life to the lord of light
keep your secrets and rain on me
all i see are mysteries in a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
when the land was swamp and caves were home
in an age when prize possession was fire
to search for landscapes men would roam
then the tribes they came to steal their fire
and the wolves they howled into the night
as they fought a vicious angry battle
to save the power of warmth and light
drawn by quest for fire
they searched all through the land
drawn by quest for fire
discovery of man
and they thought that when the embers died away
that the flame of life had burnt and died
didn't know the sparks that made the fire
were made by rubbing stick and stone
so they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger
and they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
in the search to find another fire
to regain the power of light and heat
drawn by quest for fire
they searched all through the land
drawn by quest for fire
discovery of man
drawn by quest for fire
they searched all through the land
drawn by quest for fire
discovery of man
drawn by quest for fire
they searched all through the land
drawn by quest for fire
discovery of man like a mirage riding on the desert sand
like a vision floating with the desert winds
know the secret of the ancient desert lands
you are the keeper of the mystery in your hands
nomad, rider of the ancient east
nomad, rider that men know the least
nomad, where your come from no-one knows
nomad, where you go to no-one tells
undercover of the veil of your disguise
the men that fear you are the ones that you despise
no-one's certain what your future will behold
you're a legend, your own story will be told
nomad, rider of the ancient east
nomad, rider that men know the least
nomad, where your come from no-one knows
nomad, where you go to no-one tells
no-one dares to even look or glance your way
your reputation goes before you they all say
like a spirit that can disappear at will
many claim of things, but no-one's seen you kill
nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
no man's ever understood your genius
those who see you in horizon desert sun
those who fear your reputation hide or run
you send before you a mystique that's all your own
your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone
nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
no man ever understood your genius
legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
but no-one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
some may say that you have killed a hundred men
others say that you have died and live again
nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
no man ever understood your genius from the red sky of the east
to the sunset in the west
we have cheated death and he has cheated us
but that was just a dream
and this is what it means
we are sleeping and we'll dream forevermore
and the fragment remains of our memories
and the shadows we made with our hands
deep grey, came to mourn
all the colours of the dawn
will this journeyman's day be his last?
i know what i want
i'll say what i want
and no-one can take it away
i know what i want
i'll say what i want
and no-one can take it away
but the memory still remains
all the past years, not so strange
our winter times are like a silent shroud
and the heartbeat of the day
drives the mist away
and winter's not the only dream around
in your life you may choose desolation
and the shadows you build with your hands
if you turn to the light
that is burning in the night
then your journeyman's day has begun
i know what i want
i'll say what i want
and no-one can take it away
i know what i want
i'll say what i want
and no-one can take it away
in your life you may choose desolation
and the shadows you build with your hands
if you turn to the light
that is burning in the night
then your journeyman's day has begun
yeah!
i know what i want
i'll say what i want
and no-one can take it away
i know what i want
i'll say what i want
and no-one can take it away cold as steel, the darkness waits its hour will come
a cry of fear from our children worshipping the sun
mother nature's black revenge on those who waste her life
war babies in the garden of eden shall turn our ashes to ice
sunrise has gone
freezing up the fires
sunrise has gone
numbing our desires
sunrise has gone
sunrise has gone
around the world the people stop with terror stricken eyes
a shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly
in the icy rain and whiplashed seas, there's nowhere left to run
the hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane
sunrise has gone
freezing up the fires
sunrise has gone
numbing our desires
around the world the nations wait
for some wise word from their leading light
you know it's not only madmen who listen to fools
"is this the end?" the millions cried
clutching their riches as they died
those who survive must weather the storm

gone are the days when man looked down
they've taken away his sacred crown
to be so free, it took so long
it's not journey's end, it's just begun when you see familiar faces
but you don't remember where they're from
could you be wrong?
when you've been particular places
that you know you've never been before
can you be sure?
'cause you know this has happened before
and you know that this moment in time is for real
and you know when you feel deja-vu
feel like i've been here before
feel like i've been here before
feel like i've been here before
feel like i've been here before

ever had a conversation
that you realise you've had before?
isn't it strange?
have you ever talked to someone
and you feel you know what's coming next?
it feels pre-arranged
'cause you know that you've heard it before
and you feel that this moment in time is surreal
'cause you know when you feel deja-vu
feel like i've been here before
feel like i've been here before
feel like i've been here before
feel like i've been here before ...i mean, it doesn' matter 'oo it is, i mean, the message gets through

tape shuts off out of winter came a warhorse of steel
i've never killed a woman before but i know how it feels
i know you'd have gone insane if you saw what i saw
so now i've got to look for sanctuary from the law
i met up with a stranger last night to keep me alive
he spends all his money on gambling and guns to survive
i know you'd have gone insane if you saw what i saw
so now i've got to look for sanctuary from the law
so give me sanctuary from the law
and i'll be alright
just give me sanctuary from the law
and love me tonight
tonight
i know you'd have gone insane if you saw what i saw
so now i've got to look for sanctuary from the law
oh, i can laugh at the wind ha ha ha!
i can howl at the rain ow!
down in the canyon
or out on the plains
i know you'd have gone insane if you saw what i saw
so now i've got to look for sanctuary from the law
so give me sanctuary from the law
and i'll be alright
just give me sanctuary from the law
and love me tonight
tonight
love me tonight as i lay here lying on my bed
sweet voices come into my head
oh, what it is, i want to know
please, won't you tell me? it's got to go
there's a feeling that's inside me
telling me to get away
but i'm so tired of living
i might as well end today
as i lay here lying on my bed
sweet voices come into my head
oh, what it is, i want to know
please, won't you tell me? it's got to go
there's a feeling that's inside me
telling me to get away
but i'm so tired of living
i might as well end today
as i lay here lying on my bed
sweet voices come into my head
oh, what it is, i want to know
please, won't you tell me? it's got to go
there's a feeling that's inside me
telling me to get away
but i'm so tired of living
i might as well end today we live our lives in fever
in a choking sweat of fear
in the heat of the night you can feel so much
in the heat of the night i scream 'don't touch!'
i remember a time when we used and abused
and we fought all our battles in vain
i remember a time we thought that passion was free
in the heat of the night body is a flame
we live in fever...
i hear your secret heartbeat
i can hear your silent cries
the kids have lost their freedom
and nobody cares 'til somebody famous dies
i remember a time when we used and abused
and we fought all our battles in vain
i remember a time we thought that passion was free
in the heat of the night body is a flame
fever...
we live in fever!
now we live in a world of insanity
fear is the key to what you want to be
you don't get a say the majority gets it's way
you're outnumbered by the bastards till the day you die

i hear your silent heartbeat
i hear your silent cries
oh your just in lies, lies and lies
the kids have lost their freedom
and nobody cares till somebody famous dies
keep telling lies and lies and lies...
aaaa-hahahah
i remember the time when we used and abused
ah, it was just lies
i remember the time we thought that passion was free
ah, it was just lies and lies and lies...
hear the night
we live in fever
we live in fever
now we live in a world of insanity
fear is the key to what you want to be
you don't get a say the majority gets it's way
you're outnumbered by the bastards till the day you die... como esta amigo?
for the death of those we don't know
shall we kneel and say a prayer?
they will never know we care
shall we keep the fires burning?
shall we keep the flames alive?
should we try to remember what is wrong and what is right?
no more tears, no more tears
if we live for a hundred years
amigos, no more tears
and if we do forget them
and the sacrifice they made
will the wickedness and sadness
come to visit us again?
shall we dance a dance in sunlight?
shall we drink the wine of peace?
shall our tears be of joy?
shall we keep at bay the beast?

inside the scream is silent
inside it must remain
no victory and no vanquished
only horror, only pain walk away, yeah!
look out now, baby, won't you take me away?
sitting here, think it's gonna be a new day
gonna sing my song and i can't go wrong

i want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along
i want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along
'cause i'm a drifter
drifting on
yeah! my life is so empty, nothing to live for
my mind is all confusion, 'cos i defied the law
when you weren't there to help me, i lost my mind and ran
i never had no trouble before this all began
my life is so empty, nothing to live for
my mind is all confusion, 'cos i defied the law
when you weren't there to help me, i lost my mind and ran
i never had no trouble before this all began

i'm running away, nowhere to go
i'm lost and tired and i just don't know. yeah...
they say i killed a woman, they know it isn't true
they're just trying to frame me, and all because of you. yeah... take my eyes, the things i've seen
in this world coming to an end
my reflection fades, i'm weary
of these earthly bones and skin
you may pass through me and
leave no trace, i have no mortal face
solar winds are whispering
you may hear me call
we can shed our skins and swim
into the darkened void beyond
we will dance among the world
that orbit stars that aren't our sun
all the oxygen that trapped us
in a carbon spider's web
solar winds are whispering
you may hear the sirens of the dead
left the elders to their parley
meant to satisfy our lust
leaving damocles still hanging
over all their promised trust
walk away from freedoms
offered by their jailers in their cage
step into the light
star tripping over mortals in their rage
starblind with sun
the stars are one
we are the light that brings the end of night
starblind with sun
the stars are one
we are with the goddess of the sun tonight
the preacher loses face with christ
religion's cruel device is gone
empty flesh and hallowed bones
make pacts of love, but die alone
the crucible of pain will forge
the blanks of sin, begin again
you are free to choose a life to live
or one that's left to lose
virgins in the teeth of god
are meat and drink to feed the damned
you may pass through me
and i will feel the life that you live less
step into my light star tripping
we will rage against the night
walk away from comfort
offered by your citizens of death
starblind with sun
the stars are one
we are the light that brings the end of night
starblind with sun
the stars are one
we are one with the goddess of the sun tonight
take my eyes for what i've seen
i will give my sight to you
you are free to choose
whatever life to live or life to lose
whatever god you know
he knows you better than you believe
in your once and future grave
you'll fall endlessly deceived
look into our face reflected
in the moon glow in your eyes
remember you can choose to look
but not to see and waste your hours
you believe you have the time
but i tell you your time is short
see your past and future
all the same and it cannot be bought
starblind with sun
the stars are one
we are the light that brings the end of night
starblind with sun
the stars are one
we are one with the goddess of the sun tonight
take my eyes for what i've seen
i will give my sight to you
you are free to choose
whatever life to live or life to lose
whatever god you know
he knows you better than you believe
in your once and future grave
you'll fall endlessly deceived
the preacher loses face with christ
religion's cruel device is gone
empty flesh and hallowed bones
make pacts of love, but die alone
the crucible of pain will forge
the blanks of sin, begin again
you are free to choose a life to live
or one that's left to lose i got the keys to view at number twenty-two
behind my green door there's nothing to see
is that a creature?
what kind of creature would hang around
waiting for a guy like me?
stone cold sober and sitting in silence
laid back and looking for sympathy
i like a girl who knows where she's bound
i don't like girls who've been hanging around
hooks in you, hooks in me
hooks in the ceiling
for that well hung feeling
no big deal, no big sin
strung up on love
i got the hooks screwed in
hooks in you, hooks in me
hooks in the ceiling
for that well hung feeling
no big deal, no big sin
strung up on love
i got the hooks screwed in
she's tied up and she can't come to the phone
you must have got your wires crossed
cause she ain't home
knock on wood, you know i like that sound
she never could keep her feet on the ground
hooks in you, hooks in me
hooks in the ceiling
for that well hung feeling
no big deal, no big sin
strung up on love
i got the hooks screwed in
hooks in you, hooks in me
hooks in the ceiling

gonna make this house a preservation zone
gonna set her in concrete

hooks in you, hooks in me
hooks in the ceiling
for that well hung feeling
no big deal, no big sin
strung up on love
i got the hooks screwed in
hooks in you, hooks in me
hooks in the ceiling
for that well hung feeling
no big deal, no big sin
strung up on love
i got the hooks screwed in
hooks in you
i've got those hooks in you
hooks in you, in you
hooks in you
i've got those hooks in you
hooks in you, in you stranger than the comet as it streaks across the sky
stranger than the truth i know before my open eyes
i have dealt in mysteries and trickery of light to entertain
looked into the abyss, called it by its name
i have plundered time itself, put the world inside it
i'm the mysteries, day and night, divide it
a plague of wonders, on your knees beside me
know the secrets, you shall not deride us
my dreams of empire from my frozen queen
will come to pass
know me, the magus, i am dr. dee
and this is my house
i am the master of the tides
i shame the mirror in my sight
what random music of the spheres
across the years
know this
i will return to this land
rebuild where the ruins did stand
chain up the demons set free
strange alchemy
gather round the aimless and the feckless and the lame
hear the master summon up the spirits by their names
i curse you edward kelley, your betrayal for eternity is damned
know you speak with demons, you cannot command
even as i looked into the glass then i was blinded
burning by the mortlake shore my house, my books inside it
you have taken up my wife and lain beside her
now the black rain on my house, the timbers burning
my dreams of empire from my frozen queen
will come to pass
know me, the magus, i am dr. dee
and this was my house
i was the keeper of the books
i had the knowledge of the scrolls
but now through ignorance and fear
i cast a shadow through the years
x3
know this
i will return to this land
rebuild where the ruins did stand
chain up the demons set free
strange alchemy
know this
i will return to this land
rebuild where the ruins did stand
chain up the demons set free
strange alchemy
know this
i will return to this land
rebuild where the ruins did stand
chain up the demons set free
strange alchemy the keys to death and hell
the ailing kingdom, doomed to fail
the bonds of sin and heart will break
of heaven's course, we'll take
quelling the devil's might
and ready for eternal fight
aching limbs and fainting soul
heavy battles take their toll
liberty and hope divide
changing our water into wine
so, to you we bid farewell
kingdom of heaven to hell
spirit holy, life eternal
raise me up, take me home
pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset
onward journey begun
to courage find and gracious will
deliver good from ill
clean the water, clean our guilt
with us do what you will
then will my judge appear
bear no false angels that i hear
for, only then, i will confess
to my eternal hell
now give us our holy sign
changing our water into wine
so, to you, we bid farewell
kingdom of heaven to hell
spirit holy, life eternal
raise me up, take me home
pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset
onward journey begun

now give us our holy sign
changing our water into wine
so, to you, we bid farewell
kingdom of heaven to hell
spirit holy, life eternal
raise me up, take me home
pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset
onward journey begun
spirit holy, life eternal
raise me up, take me home
pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset
onward journey begun pay to kill, die to lose
hunter, hunted, which are you?
diablo, come again
to make trophies out of men
lose your skin, lose your skull
one by one the sack is full
in the heat dehydrate
know which breath will be your last
nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
you've got to kill to stay alive
nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
you've got to kill to stay alive
show them no fear, show them no pain
show them no fear, show them no pain
show them no fear, show them no pain
show them no fear, show them no pain
human heart, human mind
intellect intertwined
focus snap in the night
watch the jungle burning bright
toe to toe, throw the line
everyone's caught hand tied
iron will, iron fist
how could it have come to this?
nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
you've got to kill to stay alive
nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
you've got to kill to stay alive
show them no fear, show them no pain
show them no fear, show them no pain
show them no fear, show them no pain
show them no fear, show them no pain
show them no fear, show them no pain as he travels on the beast of burden
moving up along the mountainside
as he gazes looking down the valley
no regrets but his pride
as he journeys across mountain passes
insignificance sweeps over him
his reflection of the beauty 'round him
feeling empty inside
he is running from his wildest thoughts
he is running from his everything
he is looking now to find something
hoping he could be saved
he's searching for the answer now
it's something that he's managed to avoid up to now
real conviction that he craves
he needs to find the answer sooner than later
pushed himself to the limits
he had to strive for all the harder things in life
but what the cost to give in now?
his life, his time are the only things that he has
life is not a rehearsal
all he has is the one chance to get it right
leaving really is the only way to know
maybe one day they'll forgive him what he's done
but now the pain of lying too early in the grave
destiny, no good to hide away
penance now will be his only way
understand, no good to run away
penance now will be his saving grace
he tries to make his peace with god
all is forgivable but it's left a little late
trying something that he's not
is it possible to change such a lot?
he's taken someone's life away
there's not a day goes by he regrets what he's done
he should have found another way
but the good book says: "an eye for an eye"
in reflecting on decisions that were made
on the judgements that will haunt him till his grave
no one has the right to take another life
but in his mind he had no choice, so be it
destiny, no good to hide away
penance now will be his only way
understand, no good to run away
penance now will be his saving grace
far, far away, the man who would be king
far, far away, the man who would be king
so far away, the man who would be king
so far away, the man who would be king
far, far away, the man who would be king i'm running out of my time
i'm running out of breath
and now it's getting to i can't sleep at night
in the day, feel like dead
i'm getting in far too deep
i feel they're closing in
i've got to say that i'm scared
i know they'll win, even so, i'm prepared
do you believe what you hear?
can you believe what you see?
do you believe what you feel?
can you believe what is real?
futureal, what is real?
futureal
wherever anyone seems to treat me like a freak
it makes me see i'm only one
who feels that i know what is real
sometimes it feels like a game of deadly hide and seek
and when you're reading this
then i will be gone
maybe then you will see

futureal, what is real?
futureal, what is real?
futureal, what is real?
futureal azazel is beside you and he's playing the game
demons are inside you and they're making their play
watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time
for a devil to get ready and take over your mind
you and only god would know
what could be done
you and only god will know
i am the only one
you and only god would know
what could be done
you and only god will know
i am the chosen one
could it be it's the end of the world?
all the things that we cherish and love
nothing left but to face this all on my own
'cause i am the chosen one
could it be it's the end of the world?
all the things that we cherish and love
nothing left but to face this all on my own
'cause i am the chosen one
beaten, fallen angel but i've risen again
and the power is inside me, i've decided to pray
as i wait for armageddon and it's coming my way
it's an honour to be chosen and i wait for the day
you and only god would know
what could be done
you and only god will know
i am the only one
you and only god would know
what could be done
you and only god will know
i am the chosen one
could it be it's the end of the world?

all the things that we cherish and love
nothing left but to face this all on my own
'cause i am the chosen one sitting, waiting in the falling rain
getting ready to begin again
wounded lying, crying
bodies moving, dying
all around there is the smell of death and fire
here the planes are coming
hear the soldiers running
killing on a scale to comprehend
why are we here?
in this place, here to kill
please god, forgive us for what we have done
i always thought i was doing right
as of now i'm not feeling so sure
i'm at a place where i give no grace
i'm a soldier of war
i sit waiting for my darkest hour to come
i cannot think about the things that i have done
it shouldn't take a fool to see that i believe
accept the consequence, repent for what i've done
you tell me what is certain
but i'll tell you what is true
you tell me what is honesty
when all around is death and cruelty
the making of man is fire
not giving in to our desires
within the truth that lies
within the only thing
mother of mercy
angel of death desire
mother of mercy
taking my last breath of fire
mother of mercy
angel of pain
mother of mercy
taking my last breath
some say you are a lost cause
some say you're a saint
just being here's an act of suffering and restraint
walk down the long dark road to ruin and panic not
i'll die a lonely death, of that i'm certain of
rivers flow with blood
there's nowhere left to hide
it's hard to comprehend there's anyone left alive
sick of all the killing and the reek of death
will god tell me what religion is to man?
i don't hold with bad religion
understand what's underneath it
now i come to think of it
i just don't hold at all, you know it
you say you are a holy man
but what is it you do?
from where i stand is nothing
but a hollow man i see

mother of mercy
angel of death, desire
mother of mercy
taking my last breath of fire
mother of mercy
angel of pain
mother of mercy
drawing my last breath
i'm just a lonely soldier
fighting in a bloody hopeless war
don't know what i'm fighting
who it is, or what i'm fighting for
thought it was for money
make my fortune, now i'm not so sure
seem to just have lost my way the rebel of yesterday, tomorrow's fool
who are you kidding being that cool?
trying to break away from running with the pack
but they ain't listening so you've gotta go back
you're a weekend warrior when you're one of the crowd
but it's over, just look at you now...
you're not so brave the way you behave
it makes you sick, gotta get out quick
it's all bravado when you're out with your mates
it's like a different person goes through those gates
and the game begins, the adrenalin's high
feel the tension maybe someone will die...
a weekend warrior lately
a weekend warrior sometimes
a weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore
you've gotta get out gotta get away
but you're in with a clique it's not easy to stray
you've gotta admit you're just living a lie
it didn't take long to work out why
it's hard to say why you got involved
just waiting to be part, just waiting to belong...
a weekend warrior lately
a weekend warrior sometimes
a weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore
some of the things that you've done you feel so ashamed
after all it's only a game... isn't it?
and after all the adrenalin's gone
what you gonna do on monday?
a weekend warrior lately
a weekend warrior sometimes
a weekend warrior maybe you were never like that at all i can hear them floating on the wind
immortal souls, their weeping saddens me
mother earth, you know your time is near
awaken lust, the seed is sown and reaped
through the western isle
i hear the dead awaken
rising slowly to the court of avalon
the cauldron of the head of annwyn laced with envy
dark around its edge with pearl and destiny
all my days i've waited for the sign
the one that brings me closer to the isle of avalon
i can feel the power flowing through my veins
my heart is beating louder close to avalon
i can hear you
can you hear me?
i can feel you
can't you feel me?
fertility mother goddess
celebration, sow the seeds of the born
the fruit of her body laden
through the corn doll
you will pray for them all
the image of mother goddess
lying dormant, in the eyes of the dead
the sheaf of the corn is broken
end the harvest
throw the dead on the pyre
i hear her crying the tears of an angel
the voices i hear in my head
blessed the fruits are the corn of the earth
mother earth, holy blood of the dead
mother earth
i can hear you
sacrifice
now united
rising levels of the tidal lakes protect them
keepers of the goddess in the underworld
holding powers of the mystics, deep inside them
nineteen maidens, guardians of the otherworld
mortal conflict
born of celtic legend
that apart from seven
none returned from avalon
mother earth
i can feel you
my rebirth
now completed
to have the belief of others
looking for the isle to show them a sign
fertility of all mothers
stood in silence waiting now for their turn
the gateway to avalon
the island where the souls of the dead are reborn
brought here to die and be transferred into the earth
and then for rebirth
the water in rivers and rhymes rises quickly
are flowing and flooding the land
the sea shall return once again just to hide them
lost souls on the isle of the dead roll of the dice
take a spin of the wheel
out of your hands now
so how do you feel?
but you're not gonna win
you'd better go back again
do you feel lucky or do you feel scared?
take what luck brings and the devil may care
but you're down on your luck
and what will the next day bring?
adrift on the ocean
afloat in a daydream
or lost in a maze
or blind in the haze
so what does it matter?
so why don't you answer?
so why did you send an angel to mend?
best make decisions, before it's too late
take all your chances
take hold of the reigns
a roll of the dice
ahead of the game again
nothing to lose, but so much to gain
a little danger, it goes without saying
but what do you care?
you're gonna go in the end
gate open to heaven is ready and waiting
or straight down to hell, can go there as well
i'll suffer my craving
my soul's not worth saving
so why don't you go?
just leave well alone
don't you think i'm a saviour?
don't you think i could save you?
don't you think i could save your life?
repeat 3x
 whispered
there's like a hunger
that knocks on your door
you've had a taste of it
still you want more
you've made your mistakes
won't play it the same again
you have been warned but
still you plunge in
you play high stakes
but there's nothing to win
you've only one life
and so many things to learn
the angel on one side
the devil the other
which path do you take?
decisions to make
arrive on the crossroads
you know where you're going
and what if you wait?
it may be too late
don't you think i'm a saviour?
don't you think i could save you?
don't you think i could save your life? i stand alone in this desolate space
in death they are truly alive
massacred innocents, evil took place
the angels were burning inside
centuries later i wonder why
what secret that they took to their grave

burned at the stake for their soul's liberty

the book of old testament crippled and black

patrolwoman saunders don't you give her no lip
took me to the station for a breath test
then back to her bedroom for some house-arrest
women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
women in uniform, but oh they feel so warm
coming back to london on a 747
stewardess made me feel like i'm in heaven
looking up the aisle to see what i could see
she leaned over said
give it to me
white apron, brown leather shoes
the nurse at the clinic left my heart all bruised
gave me a massage, sprained my right
now she takes my temperature every night

where the blood-red journey ends
when you've faced the heart of darkness
even your soul begins to bend
for a week i have been waiting
still i am only in saigon
the walls move in a little closer
i feel the jungle call me on
every minute i get weaker
while in the jungle they grow strong
what i wanted was a mission
and for my sins they gave me one
they brought it up just like room service
cause everyone gets what they want
and when that mission was all over
i'd never want another one
i know, captain, that you've done this work before
we've got a problem, you can help us all i'm sure
the colonel's gone rogue and his methods are unsound
you'll take a pbr upriver, track him down
there's a conflict in every human heart
and the temptation is to take it all too far
in this war, things get so confused
but there are some things which cannot be excused
he's acting like a god, an insane lunatic
your mission, terminate with extreme prejudice
the route is dangerous and your progress may be slow
here is the file and it's all you need to know
here i am, the knife in my hand
and now i understand why the genius must die
now i stand alone in the darkness
with his blood upon my hands
where sat the warrior, the poet
now lie the fragments of a man
i've looked into the heart of darkness
where the blood-red journey ends
when you've faced the heart of darkness
even your soul begins to bend
i've looked into the heart of darkness everybody's waiting for something to happen
everybody's waiting for something to see
lunatics waiting for bigger disasters
everyone's waiting for news on tv
winding lives at the end of the spiral
waiting dictators with their next big thrill
everyone's looking but no-one is listening
everybody wants to be in at the kill
i wait for the signs, they tell me true
i see the signs of the end of time
everyone's searching, but nothing's revealing
everyone's looking for the reason why
everyone's hoping for life ever after
everyone's looking at death from the sky
everyone's nightmares are going to happen
everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes
everyone's praying but no-one's believing
everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies
i wait for the signs, they tell me true
i see the signs of the end
so i watch and i wait and i pray for an answer
an end to the strife and the world's misery
but the end never came
and we're digging the graves
and we're loading the guns for the kill
can the end be at hand?
is the face in the sand future memory of our tragedy?
can the end be at hand?
is the face in the sand future memory of our tragedy? doctor doctor, please
don't you know i'm going fast
doctor doctor, please
don't you know i just can't last
she walked up to me and really stole my heart
and then she started to tear my body apart
livin' lovin' i'm on the run
so far away from you
livin' lovin' i'm on the run
so far away from you
doctor doctor, please
don't you know i just can't last
doctor doctor, please
don't you know i'm going fast
it's only just a moment
but she's turning paranoid
it's another situation for a nervous boy
doctor doctor, please
don't you know i'm going fast
doctor doctor, please
don't you know i just can't last
but you look so angry as i crawled across your floor
she's got the strength, i just can't take any more

so far away from you
livin' lovin' i'm on the run
so far away from you

out of the shadows and into the sun
dreams of the past as the old ways are done
out there is beauty, and surely there is pain
but we must endure it to live again
dust 'n' dreams in fading daylight

nothing new, your life's adrift
what purpose to it all?
eyes are closed and death is calling
reaching out its hand
call upon the starlight to surround you
out of the shadow and into the sun

a man who casts no shadow has no soul she lays in bed at night and that is when i make my call
but when she stares at me, she can't see nothing at all
because, you see, i can't take no shape or form
it's been three long years since i've been gone
i can't get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry
i'll never know the reason why i had to go
oh, oh, i'm crying
oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me
oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?
ah can't you see me?
i'm looking forward to her spirit coming over to me
i feel tempted to bring her over to see just what it's
like to be hanging on the other side
i feel so lonely, it's a long time since i died
i try to show her that she's never gonna be alone
because my spirit is imprisoned in the twilight zone
oh, oh, i'm crying
oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me
oh, oh, oh, can't you hear me?
ah can't you see me? i'm an educated fool
so don't know what is i'm supposed to do
about this awkward situation
that's been forced down right upon me
as i'm walking down into
on my own into the valley of life
got a lifetime of experience
i've got so much to give
open the page on chapter one
could this just be that life's just begun
forever within your darker thoughts
reflecting on everything you've been taught
never felt this way before
seems that somebody's just opened
the door to the book of life
or is it death?
is there ever any way out?
someone's looking down on me
to the very inner core of my soul
they won't tell me what they see
but i really want to know
i want to live my life on my own
i want to lift the unturned stone
i want to walk right into the fire
i want to live out all my desires
i want to go and see the fire burn
i want to see and feel my world turn
i want to know what more there's to learn
i want to pass the point of no return
do you really want to be just another one statistic
or feel that you really should aspire?
that you really do deserve more?
do you ever really feel that you have so much potential inside?
what you really have to give could be realised so much more

time will flow and i will follow
time will go, but i will follow
time will flow and i will follow
time will go, but i will follow

i want to feel what life's like respond
i want to meet my father beyond
i want to walk right into the light
i want to feel no fear but delight
i want to live my life on my own
i want to lift the unturned stone
i want to walk right into the fire
i want to live out all my desires

the educated fool 1, 2... 1, 2, 3, 4!
i'm gonna organize some changes in my life
i'm gonna exorcise the demons of my past
i'm gonna take the car and hit the open road
i'm feeling ready to just open up and go
and i just feel i can be anything
that all i might ever wish to be
and fantasize just what i want to be
make my wildest dreams come true
i'm on my way
out on my own again
i'm on my way
out on the road again
when i remember back to how that
things just used to be
and i was stuck inside a shroud of misery
i felt i'd disappeared so deep inside myself
i couldn't find a way to break away my hell
when i'm feeling down and low
i vow i'll never be the same again
i just remember what i am
and visualize just what i'm gonna be
i'm on my way
out on my own again
i'm on my way
i'm gonna break away
i'm gonna break away
i'm out on my own
i'm out on my own
i'm gonna break away
breaking away
i'm on my way
out on my own again
i'm on my way
out on the road again
i'm on my way
out on my own again
i'm on my way
i'm gonna break away when it all comes down the line
and the lights, they turn to greed
and you race off with your tires screaming
rolling thunder
and the people choke with poison
children cry in fear
but you've got one last bullet
one way ticket out of here
fall on your knees today
and pray the world will mend its ways
get to your feet again
refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
in the cities, in the streets
there's a tension you can feel
the breaking strain is fast approaching
guns and riots
the politicians gamble
and lie to save their skins
and the press get fed their scapegoats
public enema number one
fall on your knees today
and pray the world will mend its ways
get to your feet again
refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
a million network slaves
in an advertising new age
i don't need a crystal ball to sell you
your children have more brains
than your drug infested remains
california dreaming as the world dies screaming
fall on your knees today
and pray the world will mend its ways
get to your feet again
refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
fall on your knees today
and pray the world will mend its ways
get to your feet again
refugees from the heartbreak and the pain the convoy lights are dead ahead
the merchantmen lay in their bed
the trumps of diesels hammer down
in the oily sea, the killing ground
knuckles white, eyes alight
he slams the hatch on the deadly night
a cunning fox in the chicken's lair
a hound of hell and the devil don't care
running silent, running deep
we are your final prayer
warriors in secret sleep
a merchantman's nightmare
a silent death lies waiting
for all of you below
running silent, running deep
sink into your final sleep
chill the hearts of fighting men
in open ocean wondering when
the lethal silver fish will fly
the boat will shiver, men will die
a cast of millions, a part to play
killer, victim or fool for a day?
obeying an order, men have to die
us or them, a well rehearsed lie
running silent, running deep
we are your final prayer
warriors in secret sleep
a merchantman's nightmare
a silent death lies waiting
for all of you below
running silent, running deep
sink into your final sleep
the lifeboat's shattered, the hull is torn
the tar black smell of burning oil
on the way down to davy jones
every man for himself, you're on your own
the wolf eyes watch the crosswire
stern tubes ready, aim and fire
they can pin some medal on your chest
but in two more weeks, dead like the rest
running silent, running deep
we are your final prayer
warriors in secret sleep
a merchantman's nightmare
a silent death lies waiting
for all of you below
running silent, running deep
sink into your final sleep
running silent, running deep
we are your final prayer
warriors in secret sleep
a merchantman's nightmare i get in from work at 2 a.m
and sit down with a beer
turn on late night tv and
then i wonder why i am here
it's meaningless and trivial
and it washes over me
and once again i wonder
is this all there is for me
here i am again
look at me again
here i am again
on my own
trying hard to see
what there is for me
here i am again
on my own
life seems so pathetic
i wish i could leave it all behind
this canvas chair, this bed
these walls that fall in on my mind
hold on for something better
that just drags you through the dirt
do you just let go or carry on and
try to take the hurt?
alone again
alone again
i'm here on my own i can't be compromising in my thoughts no more
i can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart
i can't be sympathising with a new lost cause
i feel i've lost my patience with the world and all
and all the politicians and their hollow promises
and all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it
the working man pays everything for their mistakes
and with his life too if there was to be a war
so we only get one chance
can we take it?
and we only get one life
can't exchange it
can we hold on to what we have?
don't replace it
the age of innocence is fading like an old dream
a life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday
the victims' minds are scarred for life most everyday
assailants know just how much further they can go
they know the laws are soft, conviction chances low

you can't protect yourselves, even in your own home
for fear of vigilante cries the victims wipe their eyes
so now the criminals, they laugh right in our face
judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace
despondent public worries where it all will end
we can't protect ourselves, our kids from the crime trend
we cannot warn each other of evil in our midst
they have more rights than us, you cannot call that just
the age of innocence is fading like an old dream now i'm here, can you see me
cause i'm out on my own?
when the room goes cold
tell me you can feel me, cause i'm here
here i am, can you see me?
passing through, on my way
to a place i'd been to
only in my dreams before
in a world of delusion
never turn your back on a friend
cause you can count
your real true friends on one hand
through life
there are those that deceive you
there are those that'll let you down
is there someone out there that would die for you?
thought not
live your life with a passion
everything you do, do well
you only get out of life what you put in, so they say
in a world of confusion
people never say what they mean
if you want a straight answer
go look for one, right now
in a rooms full of strangers
do you stand with your back to the wall?
do you sometimes feel like you're on the outside looking in?
you can make your own luck
you create your destiny
i believe you have the power
if you want to, it's true
you can do what you want to
if you try a little bit harder
a little bit of faith goes a long way, it does
are we here for a reason?
i'd like to know just what you think
it would be nice to know what happened
when we die, wouldn't it?
there are some who're wise
there are some who're born naive
i believe that there are some
that must have lived before, don't you?
as for me, well i'm thinking
you gotta keep an open mind
but i hope that my life's not
an open and shut case
extra sensory perception
life after death, telepathy
can the soul live on
and travel through space and time?
you know i feel so elated
cause i'm about to find it out
and when i know all the answers
maybe then i'll come back
to fill you in
you, don't be alarmed now
if i try to contact you
if things go missing or get moved around, it's me
and don't disbelieve it
no matter what your friends might say
we'll meet up again some place some way
one day there's a madman in the corner of your eye
he likes to pry into your sunlight
he wants to burst into
the street with you and i
a world of shadows and of rain
he's seen what love is
he wants to pay you back with guilt
he lies to you, he won't let you be
he's got your chains of misery
he won't be still till he's turned your key
he holds your chains of misery
he's got your chains of misery
there's a prophet in the gutter in the street
he says you're damned and you believe him
he's got a vision but it shines out
through your eyes
a world of hatred and fear
he's felt what love means
he wants to pay you back with pain

it's only love that holds
the key to our hearts
it's only love on a cold october morning
as frost lay on the ground
waiting to make my move
i made no sound
waiting for the mist to cover all around
i carefully picked my time
then took the wall
i'm sick and tired of running
the hunger and the pain
a stop to look about
then off again
being at the wrong place
and at the wrong time
suspected of a hit
that was my crime
i am a fugitive
being hunted down like game
i am a fugitive
but i've got to clear my name
i am a fugitive
being hunted down like game
i am a fugitive
but i've got to clear my name
always looking 'round me
forever looking back
i'll always be a target for attack
ever moving  onwards
always on the run
waiting for a sight of a loaded gun
i am a fugitive
being hunted down like game
i am a fugitive
but i've got to clear my name
i am a fugitive
being hunted down like game
i am a fugitive
but i've got to clear my name

even if i find them
and get to clear my name
i know that things can never be the same
but if i ever prove my innocence someday
i've got to get them all to make them pay
i am a fugitive
being hunted down like game
i am a fugitive
but i've got to clear my name
i am a fugitive
being hunted down like game
i am a fugitive
but i've got to clear my name after the war and now
that they've sent us homeward
i can't help but feel that i'm on my own
no-one can see just what this conflict
has done to the minds of the men
who are on their way home
i'm scarred for life but it's not
my flesh that's wounded
so how can i face the torment alone?
the vivid scenes and all the recurring nightmares
i lay there and sweat until it gets light
people say "don't worry"
say that time's a perfect healer
that the nightmares, they will come to pass
can't hear what they're saying
i am living in my own world
and i'm feeling trance-like all the time
i hear voices in my head
could i really be going crazy?
in the night, the visions seem so real
do you care if you live or die?
when you laugh you are really crying
you're not sure what's real anymore
fortunes of war, fortunes of war
fortunes of war, no pain anymore
fortunes of war, fortunes of war
fortunes of war, no pain anymore
fortunes of war
fortunes of war, fortunes of war
fortunes of war, no pain anymore
fortunes of war

sometimes i wake
i feel that my spirit's broken
i wonder if i've the strength to carry on
...carry on silently to silence fall
in the fields of futile war
toys of death are spitting lead
where boys that were our soldiers bled
war horse and war machine
curse the name of liberty
marching on as if they should
mix in the dirt our brothers' blood
in the mud and rain
what are we fighting for?
is it worth the pain?
is it worth dying for?
who will take the blame?
why did they make a war?
questions that come again
should we be fighting at all?
once a ploughman hitches his team
here he sowed?
his little dream
now bodies, arms and legs are strewn
where mustard gas and barbwire bloom
each moment's like a year
i've nothing left inside for tears
comrades dead or dying, lie
i'm left alone asking why
in the mud and rain
what are we fighting for?
is it worth the pain?
is it worth dying for?
who will take the blame?
why did they make a war?
questions that come again
should we be fighting at all?
after the war
left feeling no-one has won
after the war
what does a soldier become?
after the war
left feeling no-one has won
after the war
what does a soldier become?
war is over and battles are gone
after the war that no-one has won
i'm just soldier
after the war
left feeling no-one has won
after the war
what does a soldier become?
after the war
left feeling no-one has won
after the war
what does a soldier become? bleeding you dry from the start
the sum of my parts
to give it away
new life in a day
some new frankenstein
damned for all time
cursed by the angel who fell
who saves me from hell?
and who is my god?
and where is my soul?
too tired to jump, too young to run
never-ending, forever searching
chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart
always seeking, always asking
questions right from the start
out beyond the new frontier
playing god without mercy, without fear
create a beast, made a man without a soul
is it worth the risk?
a war of god and man
i want to end my life now
but i don't know how
recycled again, a lifetime of pain
the spawn of a man
the devil has planned
never-ending, forever searching
chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart
always seeking, always asking
questions right from the start
out beyond the new frontier
playing god without mercy, without fear
create a beast, made a man without a soul
is it worth the risk?
a war of god and man
is it worth the risk?
a war of god and man

never-ending, forever searching
chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart
always seeking, always asking
questions right from the start
out beyond the new frontier
playing god without mercy, without fear
create a beast, made a man without a soul
is it worth the risk?
a war of god and man
is it worth the risk?
a war of god and man so you think you can own me
well you'd better just think again
you'd better watch you step now, woman
cause i ain't like those other men
there's something burning inside me
that makes me want to be free
and when i get these feelings, honey
you better keep away from me
there's things in life now, baby
that i know i've got to do
and i need your love now, baby
to help me see it through
look out, yeah if you're looking for something that you can keep
well baby, pass me by
but if you want something that's twenty years deep
oh baby, don't even try
but you want someone to take your soul
maybe lift you a little bit higher
i've got the fire
aaaahh!

so you think i'm skinny, don't you sell me cheap
'cause i'm as long as a country-mile
some like it wide, i like it deep
well guess which one's my style
you think you can beat me at my own game
well babe i say you're a liar
'cause i've got the fire yes i have!
aaeeehh got the fire! the words she said turned out why
desperation fills her eyes
hold her in your arms
don't let go
when you taste defeat, when you loose again
fight and win, never give in
hold her in your arms
don't let go
that girl you need
gonna knock you off your feet
that girl, you know

fight and win, never give in
hold her in your arms

don't look to the eyes of a stranger
don't look through the eyes of a fool
don't look to the eyes of a stranger
somebody's watching when the night comes down
feel someone's watching you
you've got to get away
is it the first time you've ever felt this scared?
feel the adrenaline pump
your heart begins to race
begin to run now
the sweat runs down your face
don't know which way to turn
you'd better hide yourself
he's getting close now
you'd better improvise
just hope you never reach the point of no return
could be the last time  you see the light of day
don't look to the eyes of a stranger
don't look through the eyes of a fool
don't look to the eyes of a stranger

a silent prayer to god to help you on your way
i've been depressed so long
it's hard to remember when i was happy
i've felt like suicide a dozen times or more
but that's the easy way, that's the selfish way
the hardest part is to get on with your life
you're searching in the dark
clutching at straws to find a way
you take the tarot cards and throw them to the wind
you question your beliefs
your inner thoughts, your whole existence
and if there is a god, then answer if you will
and tell me of my fate, tell me of my place
tell me if i'll ever rest in peace
if you could live your life again
would you change a thing or leave it all the same?
if you had the chance again
would you change the thing at all?
when you look back at your past
can you say that you are proud of what you've done?
are there times when you believe
that the right you thought was wrong?
all of my life i have believed
judgement of heaven is waiting for me
all of my life i have believed
judgement of heaven is waiting for me
waiting for me
waiting for me
waiting for me
 2x
waiting for me
waiting for me
waiting for me weaving a thread round your heart and your soul
deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal
ships in the night when they pass out of sight
deliver their cargo of earthly delights
to the women and children, the souls of the dead
i've opened their book and no mercy is shed
you want forgiveness and you want it cheap
i don't give redemption rewards for the meek
suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
there isn't a god to save you
if you don't save yourself
you can't blame a madman for this if you go insane
give me the strength so i carry on
trapped in a web, but i cut the threads
show you the gates of tomorrow
trapped in a web, no mercy is shed
show you the gates of tomorrow
trapped in a web, slaves to the dead
show you the gates of tomorrow
trapped in a web, but i cut the threads
show you the gates of tomorrow
suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
there isn't a god to save you
if you don't save yourself
you can't blame a madman for this if you go insane
give me the strength so i carry on
trapped in a web, but i cut the threads
show you the gates of tomorrow
trapped in a web, slaves to the dead
show you the gates of tomorrow
trapped in a web, no mercy is shed
show you the gates of tomorrow
trapped in a web, but i cut the threads
show you the gates of tomorrow i feel the breeze on my face in expectance
not very long before the storm reaches here
off in the distance the lightning is flashing again
feel something strong as the power draws near
is it the rolling of thunder that scares you?
is it the clashing of clouds that hold fear?
but all i know as i sit in a corner alone
it takes me back to my childhood again
and as i wait and i look for an answer
to all the things going round in my head
i ask myself, could it be a disaster and when
it's maybe threatening to happen again?
as the ominous light draws near
there's a lone dog howls in the park
all the people hurry inside
as a lightning flash lights dark
the storm is nearly here
only god will know
you're sitting alone, you watch
as the wind's blowing treetops
and the swaying rusting of leaves
plenty of time to perceive
as you wait for rain to fall
only god knows
the whole sky glows
maybe lightning strikes twice
maybe lightning strikes twice
maybe lightning strikes twice
maybe lightning strikes twice
maybe lightning strikes twice
maybe lightning strikes twice
maybe lightning strikes twice
maybe lightning strikes twice start, with the sun
and move on out
the future's in the skies above
the heavens unfold
and a new star is born
space and time makin' love
oh what a time we had
living on the ground
i've moved to station #5
see you next time around
next time around
as far you want, as close as you need
it's all in the mind, you know
this old world hasn't really seen it's day
it's here, time to go
oh what a time we had
living on the ground
i've moved to station #5
see you next time around
next time around
remember when it was so clear
we were young, but the memory still remains
to pick fruit from a tree
fish from the seas
now nothing's left here, but the stains
well i can't cry no more
can only be glad
there's other places we can be
if the time suits you right
i'm leaving tonight
come fly away
with me!
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
oh, yeah
start, with the sun
and move on out
the future's in the skies above
the heavens unfold
a new star is born
space and time makin' love
oh what a time we had
living on the ground
i've moved to station #5
see you next time around
next time around
it's getting faster lads! hurry up! here comes metallica in the rear-view mirror! and it's also a  by ...  at the finish it's prick... it's... and at the finish it's prick followed by the wanker, followed by cunt with arsehole finishing a close fourth all my dark dreams drift
like smoke in the breeze
the fear grips me as i fall towards my sleep
here comes the nightmare that never ends
here is the dream that makes monsters of men
in the house of my soul
in rooms of ugliness and cold
memories locked away
all the doubts and fears i never faced
now they come again
i am falling down to meet with them
fears within us all
mine awake and they stand up tall
look for the truth
deepest cut of all from you
knife of the truth
blade of hatred slicing through
i pray my sleep will break
maybe this time i won't wake
weakness i hide so well
this dagger in my mind will tell
it's my final stand
i make a fist out of each hand
to shadows of the past
take a breath and i scream attack

here is the truth
deepest cut of all from you
knife of the truth
blade of hatred slicing through why is it that some of us
are destined to stay alive?
and some of us are here just
so that we'll die?
how come the bullet hits the other guy?
do we have to try and reason why?
be it the devil or be it him
you can count on just one thing
when the time is up, you'll know
not just one power runs the show
are we the lucky ones saved for another day
or they the lucky ones who are taken away?
is it a hand on your shoulder
from the lord above?
or the devil himself
come to give you a shove?
be it the devil or be it him
you can count on just one thing
when the time is up, you'll know
not just one power runs the show
a volcano erupts and sweeps a town away
a hurricane devastates the cities in its way
the grief and misery for the ones
that are left behind
the worst is yet to come
a hell to face mankind
be it the devil or be it him
you can count on just one thing
when the time is up, you'll know
not just one power runs the show my telescope looks out into the stars tonight
a little speck of light seems twice the size tonight
the calculations are so fine
can it be growing all the time?
now i can't believe it's true
and i don't know what to do
for the hundredth time i check the declination
now the fear starts to grow
even my computer shows
there are no errors in the calculations
now it's happened, take no other view
collision course, you must believe it's true
now there's nothing left that we can do
when two worlds collide
the anger and the pain
of all those who remain
two worlds collide
who will be left alive
no place to hide
when two worlds collide
the anger, the pain
of those who remain
when two worlds collide
when two worlds collide
so who will survive
there's no place to hide
when two worlds collide

when two worlds collide
the anger, the pain
of those who remain
when two worlds collide
when two worlds collide
so who will survive
there's no place to hide
when two worlds collide
when two worlds collide
the anger, the pain
when two worlds collide
when two worlds collide now the contract's out
they've put the word aloud
i'm coming after you
it's not the money i make
it's the thrill of the chase
and i'm coming after you
i watch your every move
study the things you do
and the pattern of your ways
i watch the way you walk
i hear your telephone talk
i want to understand the way you think
better watch out, 'cause i'm the assassin
better watch out, 'cause i'm the assassin
better watch out, better watch out
better watch out, 'cause i'm the assassin
better watch out, 'cause i'm the assassin
better watch out, better watch out
assassin, assassin
assassin, assassin
i'm in a cold, cold sweat
i taste the smell of death
i know the moment's getting closer
and as you walk to the light
i feel my hands go tight
excitement running though my veins
i've got you in my sights
i've got you dead to rights
trigger's waiting for my finger
i feel adrenaline rush
it's just the final touch
and you can kiss you arse goodbye
better watch out, 'cause i'm the assassin
better watch out, 'cause i'm the assassin
better watch out, better watch out
better watch out, 'cause i'm the assassin
better watch out, 'cause i'm the assassin
better watch out, better watch out
assassin sometimes it makes me wonder
sometimes it makes me question
sometimes it makes me saddened
always it makes me angry
but when you can see it happening
madness that's all around you
nobody seems to worry
the world seems so powerless to act
it's out of control
blood on the world's hands
each day a new toll
another assassination
the same day a new creation
but what are they coming into?
security of a world that brings
one day another killing
somewhere there's someone starving
another a savage raping
meanwhile there's someone laughing at us
it's out of control
blood on the world's hands
each day it goes on
blood on the world's hands
blood on the world's hands
blood on the world's hands
blood on the world's hands
brutality and aggression
tomorrow another lesson
expecting another air raid
praying for a ceasefire
they say things are getting better
no need to be complacent
there's chaos across the border
and one day it could be happening to us
it's out of control
blood on the world's hands
it's our epitaph
it's out of control
someone should know
blood on the world's hands
someone should- it's over your head
and you don't seem to understand
one word i say
and you can't live your life
trying to run away
you're fighting your friends
you're wearing everyone
but it never ends
you're wearing me out
come on
reach out reach out
and let someone into your life
don't get me wrong
you always apologise
it's just your way
of making a scene
you need to be loved
it's not such a crime
come on
reach out reach out
and let someone into your life
come on
reach out reach out
and let someone into your life

over your head
you just don't seem to understand
one word i say
and you can't live your life
you got so much love
it's burning inside
come on
reach out reach out
and let someone into your life
come on
reach out reach out
and let someone into your life
reach out reach out
and let someone into your life in the heat of the morning
when your day is still dawning
and your bird, she's singing
catch your soul, he's willing to fly away
packed your bags in a hurry
because your mind's in a worry
mark my words, you're gonna be sorry if you ever fly away
sweet little girl with the saint da vinci-smile
stares at me with sadness in her eyes
i'm not sure if she's really real or make-believe
maybe she's a vision that comes to only me
cause i'm so tired
yes i'm so tired
so tired
yes i'm so tired
solo
repeat first verse when you start to take a look within
do you feel at ease with what you see
do you think you can have peace of mind
and have self belief or be satisfied
do you think you even like yourself
or really think you could be someone else
is there something that you'd rather be
never thought you'd be, had the chance to see
all my life i've run away
all my life i've tried to hide away
feel the paranoia creeping in
like a cancer eating at the skin
do you feel you've lost your self-esteem
and your self respect, what can you expect
all my life i've run away
all my life i've tried to hide away
all my life i've run away
all my life i've tried to hide away
all my life i've run astray
let my faith  slip away
all my life i've run astray
allowed my faith to drift away

are you scared to look inside your mind
are you worried just at what you'll find
do you really want to face the truth
does it matter now, what have you got to lose
try to release the anger from within
forgive yourself a few immortal sins
do you really care what people think
are you strong enough to release the guilt
all my life i've run away
all my life i've tried to hide away
all my life i've run astray
let my faith  slip away
all my life i've run astray
allowed my faith to drift away
all my life i've run astray
let my faith  slip away
all my life i've run astray
allowed my faith to drift away the vikings are coming
you'd better get ready for we're having a fight
the longboats are coming
they're looking like dragons in the dead of the night
muster the men from all the villages
you'd better get ready to fight with your enemies
beacons are burning
i'm giving the word to get ready to fight
the battle is nearing
you'd better get ready to fight for your lives

the norsemen are coming
the norsemen are coming

when i remember back the memories of yesterday
with all the friends and all the times
when people were carefree
and walking down the street
when everyone knew everyone
and all the houses doors were open
no had to care those days are gone
those days are gone
i long for the times when you could
wander down the street unharmed
when people didn't have much money
but didn't seem to care
it must be the cynic in me
but i don't really like things now
the violence, the attitudes
aggression that you see every day
a sick society looks the other way giving a swish with your arse in the air
don't you know what they're saying?
charlotte you're so refined
when you take all the love that they're giving
sticking with every man that you find
don't you know what they're after?
charlotte you've got your legs in the air
don't you hear all their laughter?
charlotte the harlot
show me your leg
charlotte the harlot
take me to bed
charlotte the harlot
let me see blood
charlotte the harlot
let me see love
taking so many men to you room
don't you feel no remorse
you charge them a fiver only for starters
and ten the main course
you've got no feelings
they died long ago
don't you care who you let in
don't you know you're breaking the law
with the service you're giving
charlotte the harlot
show me your leg
charlotte the harlot
take me to bed
charlotte the harlot
let me see blood
charlotte the harlot
let me see love
there was a time when you left me standing there
picking up pieces of love from the floor
well charlotte you left me alone in there
to make your ends as a bloody whore
well charlotte you told me you loved me true
picking up pieces of love yesterday
well charlotte your drawers are off colour too
'cause you're making love all day
giving a swish with your arse in the air
don't you know what they're saying?
charlotte you're so refined
when you take all the love that they're giving
sticking with every man that you find
don't you know what they're after?
charlotte you've got your legs in the air
don't you hear all their laughter?
charlotte the harlot
show me your leg
charlotte the harlot
take me to bed
charlotte the harlot
let me see blood
charlotte the harlot
that can say he's good or bad
no label and no tell tale sign
that can show he's full of lies
by your deeds you will be known
time will tell truth will show
as we exhale every breath
we all got closer to our death
what will you say

ignorance is bliss is that the reason
we can not read another's mind
if we knew what thoughts were dancing
through each others heads
would we all be driven mad
would we all be dead
by your deeds you will be known
time will tell truth will show
as we exhale every breath
we all got closer to our death
what will you say

on judgement day
on judgement day one, two, three, four...

oh, and the world and...
so we can only get one chance, can we take it
and we only get one life, can't exchange it

through the hole in the wall
he's a coward but he doesn't care...
doesn't care if lives or if he dies
the general commanding
defending what we feel
the troops they are depending
on reinforcements from the rear

for the massacre

iron maiden - she's gone

i've been gone a long long time, waiting for you
i din't want to see you go
and now it's hurting so much, what can i do?
i wanted you to be my wife
the days are passing slowly, since you've gone
your memories are all i have
i sit here waiting but you'll never show
without you i can't carry on
you said you'd always love me, all of my life
and then you said your last goodbye
why the sudden change, why all the lies
i should have seen it in your eyes
the endless hours of heartache, waiting for you
my summer love has turned to rain
the silent emptiness of one sided love
my life means nothing now you're gonefrank beard/bill gibbons/dusty hill
