# Music Machine
### Explore the culture of a city via its music 

Not everyone has time to explore all of the artists local to a given city. If you're just passing through, or even if you want to learn about the music coming from your home base, how do you find local music? 

Music Machine will narrow down the options based on songs in a user's Spotify library, so that they can connect directly to artists that they're more likely to enjoy.
