# Music Machine
### Explore the culture of a city via its music 

Not everyone has time to explore all of the bands and artists local to a given city. If you're just passing through, or even if you want to discover more music coming out of your current area, how can you quickly and easily find artists you like? 

Music Machine will narrow down the options based on the features of songs in a user's Spotify library.
